1,When I saw the picture I was excited. I was going to give this as a 30th birthday present but I decided to try if for myself. It was a huge let down.  I don't remember wink soda and it tasted like a generic mountain dew.  The candy could have been from any decade. BTW where were the gummy savers. It was mostly generic stuff. Not worth the price at all. Shipping was too much. If they would take out that nasty generic soda the shipping could be cut in half.,1
2,"When this movie first came out about fifteen years ago, my father owned a video store and every Wednesday night was ""Beetlejuice"" night. I'm older now, obviously, but I still cannot get enough of this movie. <p>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara Maitland, two Connecticut yuppies who die prematurely in a car wreck. Within a couple weeks, their home is overrun by an ultra-trendy New York City family, Charles and Delia Deetz, and their Goth daughter, Lydia (played respectively by Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want their house back, and attempt to scare the Deetz's out of the house by wearing sheets and even by possessing them over dinner, making them sing and dance to Harry Belafonte's ""Day O."" Those attempts fail and enter Michael Keaton as Betelguese, ""the afterlife's leading freelance bio-exorcist."" The movie is dark without being scary and funny without being ridiculous. <p>In my opinion, one of the real gems in this film is the late Sylvia Sidney as Juno, Your Case Worker. Sidney was pushing eighty when this film was made, but turns in a great performance as the embittered equivalent of an afterlife social worker. Love how the smoke from her ever-present cigarette comes out of the slit in her throat. <p>If you've never seen this movie, see it. If you have seen it but don't own it on DVD, get it. The picture quality is better than ever.",1
3,Good price and great taste. You can tell it is organic and of good quality. I will definitely buy it again and probably even try the white tea as well.,1
4,"I never received the item.  It was in my area for at least 5 days, I had tracked it and talked to the UPS people.  Still, it never got to me.  I called the company it was produced by, they said call UPS and/or fill out complaint to Amazon.  I called UPS numerous times but didn't contact Amazon because I want nothing to do with Pay Pal.",0
5,I read a review and was excited to try this salt. I didn't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion. It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too!,0
6,It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.,0
7,"I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!<br /><br />1 1/2c milk<br /><br />2 heaping spoonfuls (the spoon that's included) green tea powder<br /><br />1/8c simple syrup (I make it myself and keep in fridge for week or so)<br /><br />10+ice cubes (adjust to your taste - depends on size of cubes)<br /><br />Blend this in a blender - longer than you think - pulse first then blend for a bit - I scrape down a bit bc the powder flies around a little and you don't want to lose any. (Simple syrup is 1c water, 1c sugar heated until sugar dissolves) It is much easier than it may sound - I make these daily in the morning. I hope this helps anyone else out there who is addicted to the GT Frappuccino - it is slightly different (I think they use a different gt powder and a honeydew syrup), but I liked mine MORE within the first week of having them!",1
8,"My primary reason for looking at unconventional salts was not for any kind of magical healing powers, but because I've learned how bad chemically processed salts are for you.<br /><br />I'm all for marketing even if it makes your product sound like it came right from the heavens... but I'm also for doing your own research.<br /><br />""Himalayan Salts"" don't come from the mountains themselves... instead it typically comes from Pakistan a few hundred miles away.  That's not to necessarily say the mineral deposits wouldn't have come from the mountains, but it sounds a lot less exotic when you find it's the same stuff that's used to salt the roads over there.<br /><br />There are a lot of varying reports on Himalayan salt... many suggesting that it is indeed high in lots of great minerals, but any balanced report seems to suggest it's also be high in other stuff you don't want too much of, such as fluoride....  The supposed ancient lake this salt came from is from the dinosaur age, but just look what happened to them ;).<br /><br />I'm not sure what to believe now, but when I realized I was wasting way too much time I decided I'd just switch to French Gray Sea Salt also sold by the Spice Lab... If you check The Spice Lab's website, they've actually got a link to their supplier in France who seems to have been around for hundreds of years harvesting salt the old fashioned way free of any chemical/artificial processing... Many of their workers have even been in the salt harvesting industry for many generations.  Sounds good to me, much less fairy tail like.  In comparison, I watched a video online about Himalayan salts and the lady said it was important that Himalayan Salts be removed by hand to preserve it's good vibrations....<br /><br />I'm positive that this Himalayan salt is many times better than ordinary table salt, and it tastes great too!  But to best accomplish what I set out to do, I think the French Gray Salt sounds like a no-nonsense quality product that fits the bill.",1
9,"Dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy, but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier.

11,"My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!",1

15,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.",0
16,"I just received these 'k-cups' a few days ago. I ordered them on subscribe and save because of the value. I failed to read all reviews, just a few to make sure they were good. When I opened the package, I thought I was sent a wrong item...until I realized these are k-cups, but not the usual looking ones. They are foil sealed with a plastic ring around the top, and the rest of it is a filter. When placed in the brewer, just a hole gets punched on the top, not bottom. Something new perhaps? I tried a cup and I admit, it was very good coffee, full flavor. I will purchase these again and do recommend them. These do arrive in a shipping box, but the k-cups are sealed in plastic bags.",1
17,Bought it for the ice cream maker which did not make ice cream since then sitting in the fridge.,0
18,"These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.<br /><br />Only downside is that it uses vanillin, rather than real vanilla.  However, it goes great with ice cream and fruits!",1
19,"Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years.  As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers.  This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients.  Real meat and rice were substituted with ""meat by-product"" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be ""unfit for human consumption"".  They are taking ingredients that used to be considered ""waste"" and packaging it up as ""healthy & nutritious"" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not ""sold-out"" yet.  The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy.  We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of ""aflatoxin poisoning"" from the ""healthy & nutritious"" dog food we were buying and feeding him.  This was NOT cheap food folks.  This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as ""Natural"", that we were paying $60/bag for.  The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer.  They are still producing their ""high priced waste"" and heavily marketing it as ""natural"".<br /><br />My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often!  Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence.  Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet.",1
20,"I purchased 2 Aerogrow units--one worked, one didn't. The 800 Aerogrow service number does not respond after many tries. no email response.

21,"Here's a review by someone who is not fat, not on a diet, and who has not ruined his palate with fat free confections:<br /><br />These are the worst brownies I have ever tasted!  My wife bought this mix because it was the only one available at Trader Joe's when she shopped.  She didn't tell me they were fat free, but as soon as I tried one, I knew.  It had all the hallmarks of fat-free baked goods - gummy, flat, and the chocolate tasted like cocoa powder, not like rich fudgy chocolate.  I almost had to spit it out, it was that awful.<br /><br />And do you want to know why fat free foods taste so bad?  I'll let you in on a little secret:  the secret ingredient in good-tasting food is... you guessed it - FAT!!!!!  Fat and oil molecules transport the lovely taste of foods onto your taste buds.  So stop being so afraid of fat!  A little bit won't kill you!  Just exercise a little self-control and don't eat the entire box.  One properly made brownie is more satisfying than a whole plate of these vile things.<br /><br />So if you like real food that tastes good, don't believe the reviewers that raved about these brownies.  These people have a hidden agenda - they are trying to convince themselves that these little nuggets of evil actually taste good and are good for them.",0
22,i just got it and it is old and does not worth it...the taste is not as good either i did not get it why they get so many 5 stars rating......................it is the worse product i have ever bought from online ever<br />do not waste your money... some people compare this with grocery stores dried cherries ..... funny.... this product sucks big big time,0
23,These are made in china...not a good idea at all considering all the food saftey issues of late. also i feel that it is wrong to buy food/agricultural products from another country (a politically hostile one at that) when our own poor farmers are having such a rough time making ends meet because all their work has been outsourced to these unsafe chinese farms. there are many much safer and ethically sound alternatives to these snacks.,0
24,"Thought that there was a seal on the top of this bottle after I opened the tab on the flip top.

25,"Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.<br /><br />It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.<br /><br />Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.<br /><br />I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way,<br />Fran B.",0

27,"Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever.",1

29,It's small and granular and makes your bread rise. There's quite a lot of it here too. I'm not sure how I'm ever going to use it all up making two loaves of bread a week.,0
30,"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.",0
31,"The wet dough sourdough product is excellent.  Upon feeding and expanding it woke up very quickly and leavened loafs extremely well.  Lots of classic sourdough taste and lots of gas production. But as a university microbiologist, I can't just try out a sourdough starter. I had to take it to the lab and find out what's in it.  I am happy to report that the starter contains precisely what it should: one species of yeast and one species of lactic acid bacteria. It is a complex task to definitively identify them as the authentic Saccharomyces exiguus and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, but everything is consistent so far with them being derived from authentic San Francisco sourdough.  In particular, as one subcultures them repeatedly, the levels of each stay pretty consistent.  This is a hallmark of an authentic sourdough starter pair of microbes. I highly recommend this product.",1
32,"Initially I was a fan of Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee. It's convenient, it's tasty, and it's an affordable alternative to an in-store iced coffee. However after taking the product home, I was shocked to discover just how much sugar it contains. The first thing you notice when emptying the packet into a cup is the huge amount of white granules staring back at you.<br /><br />Each VIA packet contains 22g of sugar, and just 4.6g of coffee! This is the equivalent of SIX packets of sugar! Starbucks says each VIA is two servings, meaning 11g of sugar each, but you're likely to have the whole thing (14-16oz with water) in one sitting. That's 100 empty Calories (more if you're adding cream).<br /><br />PROS: Quick, tasty.<br />CONS: Too much sugar, slightly bitter/burnt taste.<br /><br />NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Starbucks needs to either cut the sugar content in half, or make a ""light"" version using Splenda or Stevia as a sweetener.",1

34,"I bought these for my 3 month-old lab. I also bought some other treats (dehydrated liver, Kong biscuits, bully sticks). 1-2 days after feeding these to my lab she got violently ill -- vomiting and diarrhea. Took her to the vet and after an overnight stay and IV fluids, the vet had no idea what it was. They decided to x-ray her to see if something was blocking her intestines. Nothing. After antibiotics and rest she was back to her normal high energetic self. I gave her more of these sweet potato fries about a week after her first sickness episode.... and 24 hrs later she was vomiting again.  I was worried, but figured that it must be something I was feeding her. I then examined the package and saw these are made in China.  I threw them out and my puppy has been fine since. Logic points to these treats.... I will no longer buy food items for my dog from China. Nobody else has posted anything about ill reactions to these treats, but search around, lots of dog treats from China are making our dogs sick.",1
35,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.",1

39,"Can you stand a differing opinion?  Please read this.<br /><br />Recently, I bought the box of 24 of this product.  I thought it might be good food to have in case of emergency.  However, this is the first time I've bought something on Amazon that had universal praise, but I disagree with it.  I am wondering what kind of Italian food these people are used to?  Do they actually know how Italian sauce is supposed to taste?  Because this is not tasty!  Actually, I found it rather yucky, and three other members of my family confirmed the same result.<br /><br />I followed the directions & made this exactly as was stated on the box.  The sauce you end up with has an undefinable, very strong taste to it.  Looking at the ingredients on the side of the box, it just lists ""spices"" so I don't know what that bad taste is really coming from.<br /><br />Also, the Kraft brand spaghetti is not very good quality.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to snap it to make it fit in the pot.  Other than that, the spaghetti is tasteless, fat, limp and bland.  Thank goodness there is not very much of that spaghetti (it only serves 4 from the box).<br /><br />On top of not liking this product, I found that the actual components are overpriced.  You should just buy some excellent pasta, such as Barilla spaghetti that doesn't cost very much and makes alot more servings.  Add to that any jar of pre-made sauce.  In a side by side taste test, I bet the Barilla+jarred sauce would taste way better.<br /><br />For now, I'm going to use up the awful Kraft noodles as well as I can, and chuck the ""flavor"" packets into the garbage.",0

43,"I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1
44,"I've been buying dried blueberries from the grocery store for ages, and struggled everytime I had to buy a tiny bag that only lasted 2 days. I went online to see if I could find them in bulk, and low and behold...! I use these on everything: Spinach salads, cereal, yogurt, trail mix, even just to snack on plain. These blueberries are acutally better than the ones I was buying before, because they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Sugar is actually healthier and tastes better. I will buy these again and again.",1
45,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!",1

But...the bag I received was really lacking in excitement.  I understand that they couldn't include everything listed and that the collection might vary somewhat.  But there were NONE of the following from their list:  Rain Forest Nut, Pumpkin Spice, Mocha Nut Fudge, Island Coconut, Caramel Vanilla Creme, Mudslide, Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Vanilla Cupcake, Pecan Praline.  Of ALL of those flavors, I would have thought ONE of them would show up.  I received SEVEN of one kind, Jamaican Me Crazy.  So, that's more than a quarter of the sampler being the very same kind.  I wish more care was taken to pack the K-cups with more thought for the customer.  I am not one of those grouchy reviewers who is never pleased with anything.

It makes a lovely chocolate sauce that hardens on contact when it touches something frozen. I add the sauce to banana icecream, which is made from frozen bananas which I run through my juicer machine with the blank plate to make raw soft serve.

He still loves the outdoor activity of his garden (at 92) but is having a good time with this as well.

55,"This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.",1

57,"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.",1

60,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.",0

63,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

74,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty.

Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0

Well, the company seems to be ignorant of the whole stabilized<br />/unstabilized oat dilemma, even after I explained it to them.  I bought 5# of these and, unfortunately, like so many other ""raw"" oat groats on the market, these will not sprout- they have been stabilized!<br />So if you are looking for sproutability, and I would encourage you to do so since soaking/sprouting creates a dynamic boost in nutrients and flavor, in addition to neutralizing the anti-nutrients which are in *all* seeds, nuts and grains.  This is an important factor in protecting and healing the gut.",1

77,"I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)<br /><br />I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.<br /><br />I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective. I have learned that some products are made in the US, but when I called I only inquired about the erythritol, which they themselves confirmed was made in China.<br /><br />NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.<br />Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />-I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.<br />-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.<br />-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.  This was as a result of a legitimate concern.<br />-I did not know at the time that only some products came from China -- the customer service rep did not make that distinction when I asked. I was therefore worried about all of them.<br />-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.<br /><br />Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />This company should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.",1

Both of my dogs have put on WAY too much weight... and one of my dogs (both border collies) is an EXTREMELY ACTIVE & fit ""frisbee dog"".  My other BC, however, has battled lyme disease - and so has achy joints and fatigue. It makes exercise difficult, and the weight has piled on.<br /><br />My dogs LOVE the taste of Taste of the Wild (Buffalo)- so much so that they have been PICKING it out of the weight control food that I mix with Taste of the wild (I'm in the process of switching to a lower fat content food)!<br /><br />Having fed Taste of the Wild for the past 2 1/2 years, I can say that their coats are BEAUTIFUL.. shiny and healthy...their stools are firm and ""consistent"" (easy to pick up)..they love the taste.. and the price for such a high quality food is very affordable (I buy it from Tractor Supply). 1 of my dogs is wheat-intolerant, so this has been very easy on his system!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this food is a little bit TOO good, and now I must put both dogs on a diet!<br /><br />I'm hoping Taste of the Wild will create a version of this product that is more around 10-12% fat content so that we can once again feed our dogs this WONDERFUL food.<br /><br />*Note, I do not over-feed. My dog who battles the effects of lyme disease (which was treated somewhat successfully), received less than the recommended amount for a dog that is 65 lbs.  My other dog, 40 lbs, ate the recommended amount.<br /><br />**UPDATE** :  AFTER writing my initial review, I opted to keep one of my dogs on this food for awhile as I researched what food would be best for him.  Then, as his activity level went up - he went from having gained a few lbs, to losing weight very rapidly, and was ""scary"" thin.  Our vet evaluated the food, and as it turns out, grainless food is not for him and his activity level (not enough fuel to burn).  Our dogs LOVED this food, and I believe it is a very high quality, affordable, healthy food for dogs.  It just didn't work out for mine, unfortunately.",1

For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.

I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor.

I have not had any sediment at the bottom of my cup (I've had sediment from other K-Cups). I think people are a bit thrown by the smell of the coffee bag when they get it, as it is a much stronger smell than you'll get from a box of K-Cups. It does smell like when you open a fresh bag/can of ground coffee, which is sort of refreshing after using K-Cups for 3 years. We've just finished the first bag of 12 (6 days), which we kept in a ziplock bag, and the last cup tasted as good as the first.

However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.",1
109,"If you love using your bread machine and want a reliable yeast that does not need to be proofed (can't remember the last time I did that), then this yeast will make your life much easier. While this is not a rapid yeast, the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store. This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the ""Is this going to rise or not?"" feeling.<br /><br />The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use. Unlike the yeast cakes, you don't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk. You just measure it into the bread machine.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread. It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand. We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese. Perfect with homemade soup in the winter.<br /><br />Focaccia for the Bread Machine (start in machine, finish by hand)<br /><br />2 1/2 cups water<br />2 tablespoons Saf instant yeast<br />2 tablespoons sugar<br />2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />6 cups all-purpose flour (the Baker's Catalogue sells an amazing flour)<br /><br />Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine<br />pan.<br /><br />Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a ""just warm enough"" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.<br /><br />Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals. Then brush with olive oil. Let the bread rise until almost doubled.<br /><br />Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt. You can also top the dough with tomato slices, onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking.<br /><br />Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.<br /><br />After the bread cools, it will slice easily and it freezes very well. I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches.<br /><br />To make an Herbed Cream Cheese: Blend together 1/3 cup butter, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.<br /><br />The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle. After arriving home from visiting my grandmother, I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup.<br /><br />This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving.<br /><br />The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine, you end up feeling like a professional baker. The results are sure to impress. The bread always has a ""fresh from the bakery"" taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1
110,"Okay, it is a good rice. Tilda Basmati is a completely fantastic rice if separate rice grains are an important thing to you.<br /><br />I should say that I purchased a Zojirushi NS-LAC05 rice cooker. If you want rice to make a difference, buy a really good rice cooker. Rice does not have to be a filler substance.<br /><br />Tilda Basmati Rice has extra-super long grains. The grains are so long that many of them curl after being prepared. This is an absolutely superb rice if a fluffy, separate grain rice is of high priority. There is a place for that and I am quite thankful for my purchase for that category of need. Tilda really is a great, high quality rice for common rice needs.<br /><br />Since I got my Zojirushi rice cooker, well, the cooker really brings out the differences in rice. If you just prepare your rice in a saucepan on the stove, it really doesn't matter all that much to buy an upper level quality rice IMHO. No offense to saucepan/stove-top people. Rice is a good and often necessary food item. Stove-top prep is certainly better than not having it. HOWEVER, my Zojirushi rice cooker has really made rice a whole 'nuther deal.<br /><br />And to my point: Tilda Basmati is a really great rice if you want fluffy rice with separate rice grains. Fluffy rice with separate grains is a totally valid category. In fact, it may be what most people want. I feel that my Tilda Basmati is a very high quality rice. My only disappointment is that it is in that extra long grain category and the fact that it produces very separate rice grains, which could be a very positive aspect to many, if not most. I just happen to like rice that sticks together more.<br /><br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat next time I need long grain rice that has very separate grains. Since I purchased a 10-Pound bag, I may not need to buy more for a while.<br /><br />Very highly recommended if you want fluffy rice with separate grains. Not much good for sushi rice.",0
111,"I first heard about steel cut oats on the Oprah show about its health benefits.  First of all I DO NOT like regular oatmeal like you buy in the grocery store.  I don't like the slimy texture.  But I figured I'd try steel cut oats and I'm glad I did.  They are delicous and very good for you!  The warm nutty aroma when they are cooking is very appetizing.  I add a little bit of sugar or splenda and some cinnimon, it tastes fantastic!  I also sometimes skip the cinnimon and add a tablespoon of granola and/or some dried berries.  Excellent healthy breakfast.<br /><br />Normally these take about 30 minutes to cook on the stovetop.  I found a way to cut the cooking time in half.  Take 1/3 cup of oats, and 1 1/3 cup of water and put it in a large microwavable bowl.  Cook in the microwave on High for 5 minutes, stir, then another 5 minutes, then stir again, and then cook about another 2-3 minutes until the texture is just the way you like it.<br /><br />For those of you who are asking what the difference is between regular oatmeal and steel cut oatmeal:<br /><br />-Steel-Cut Oats are whole grain groats (the inner portion of the oat kernel) which have been cut into two or three pieces using steel discs. Golden in color and resembling mini rice particles, they are as nature intended - nothing added and nothing taken out.<br /><br />-Rolled oats are flake oats that have been steamed, rolled, re-steamed and toasted. Due to all of this additional processing they have lost some of their natural taste, goodness and texture.",1

And not that cheap.<br /><br />Shame on this company for selling this hot pepper sauce under the name Harissa. Shame shame shame.",1
114,"When it comes to junk food, I usually stick with Ding Dongs, Ho Hos, and other Hostess products.  But recently my friend (Walter) recommended M&Ms.  I'd never tried M&Ms before, so I bought a bag to see if they are any good.  I didn't like them at all.  In fact, I flushed most of the bag down the toilet (hopefully this didn't harm any alligators).<br /><br />Maybe I've been spoiled by Hostess products, but when I buy a snack item, I expect a creamy filling.  M&Ms do not have a creamy filling, and they taste awful.  Avoid.",0
115,"Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.  The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting.<br /><br />Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September.",1

118,"This starter makes delicious yogurt. I like to use it with whole milk. You must first heat the milk up to at least 180 degrees and then cool it to 73-77 degrees. As the previous reviewer stated, you must use an icewater bath to cool the milk down. This works wonderfully. I let my yogurt incubate 15 hours and it is extremely thick and delicious! It has a bit of a tart taste, which is very yummy. I alternate using this yogurt with the Yogourmet freeze-dried yogurt for variety. I eat yogurt every single day and have been using Yogourmet starters for a couple of years now. I won't use any other brand as I've tried several and the ones from Yogourmet are the best.",1

120,"A couple of the kids in the neighborhood like to play 'Cops and Robbers' when their family is over -- where they're the cops, I'm the perp, and it's 'Violating Civil Rights' week on Law & Order, apparently.

121,"The mini-milks usually sell 6 for about $3.25. This product that is listed for $18+ is supposed to be SIX packages of SIX mini-milks, which works out to be a little over $3 per sixpack, which is the correct price. But if you order it, they will ship only ONE six pack... making these mini-milks more expensive than the big milks (which sell at 13.5 ounce, six to a pack, for $14+)! It took me two hours talking to customer service to get this mistake corrected. The person who entered this in inventory misunderstood that it is a sixpack of sixpacks... so he/she entered it as one package of six.

126,"I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 ""neopolitan""(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan.",1

128,"I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can ""think out of the k-cup.""",1
129,"I run my automatic bread maker at least twice a week, so I go through a lot of yeast.  I measure out my own dry bread mix according to a couple of recipies and store it in the freezer.  I mix five batches at a time.  To start the machine on any given day, I just reach for a single-batch container.<br /><br />When I am putting up the dry mix, I am committed.  I have to be sure I have enough of each ingredient to start with.  Having a pound of Saf Instant Yeast on hand saves me from running to the store for the little 4 oz. jars or fiddling with teensy-weensy foil packets, which are just the wrong size. I store the instant yeast in the freezer, too, by the way.<br /><br />I don't worry about ingredients much.  I add a tablespoon of vital gluten to each batch to make up for any deficiency in the flour.  However, there is one ingredient that has to be perfect:  the yeast.  If it ""don't go,"" I've wasted the first batch.  Then I have to get good yeast and go back and add it to unused batches.

131,"Like other customers, I was sorely disappointed to find out that there is indeed BPA-containing plastic in the lid of Earth's Best food products.  I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies.  The company will not answer questions directly online or on their FaceBook accounts.  They give you the runaround to call their customer service number.  However, when they do finally admit to BPA being in the lid of the products, they try to pass it off as being an ""industry standard"" and that the food is ""Safe.""  Well, for those of us who are concerned enough to purchase organic foods--I think we want to see NO BPA in the packaging or product.  I am not content to be told what is safe or acceptable for my baby by a company's marketing department.  So, I have decided that, even though my baby has enjoyed Earth's Best products, I will find other products that do not have BPA in their packaging or food items.  I am truly disappointed that this huge manufacturer of ""organic"" products is allowing a product that has been banned in baby bottles in Europe to be in the lids of food jars in the United States. Shame on them.  I hope this helps other moms & dads out there to be aware of what is in this ""organic"" food product.",1
132,"I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. The extract is a chemical compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles.<br /><br />How about where it says in the label that ""White truffles originate in Alba, Italy and are considered to many to be the most prestigious truffles""...do you suppose that means white truffles from Italy have anything to do with this concoction? Well, they don't. They might as well have written, ""The sun is so and so many miles away from the earth."" They put that sentence in just to further trick you so you think that you are getting an expensive product with a grand tradition behind it when all you are getting is some cheap oil with some synthetic chemical added to it.<br /><br />They should be ashamed of themselves. Should they be allowed to sell you a synthetic chemical to eat? Maybe. Should they be allowed to market the product to convince customers that they are getting a product made with real truffles? No, they absolutely should not. We have food laws that are supposed to protect customers from this sort of trickery. The FDA has really dropped the ball on this.<br /><br />Update: They are getting even trickier. Their label has now been changed to read truffle extract instead of truffle aroma. I called the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see section 201 for definitions) has never defined the term extract. I was specifically told this on the phone by an FDA representative. She said because the term extract has not been legally defined by this act, anything can be called an extract. Thus, La Tourangelle can legally get away with calling something a truffle extract even if truffles weren't used to make it.",1
133,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

136,"I got this for my long hair male cat who has been prescribed wet food by the vet after having urinary tract problems. I read about Weruva and that the Paw Lickin' Chicken would be good for him and keep his urine pH at levels to prevent struvite crystals, just like the vet prescribed food. The Paw Lickin' Chicken has a lot of water and low magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium. But unlike the veterinarian recommended food, it has no byproducts or fillers or grains. Weruva actually looks like food, not gruel, and it doesn't have an unpleasant smell like a lot of cat foods. Weruva costs almost as much as the vet prescribed brand, but Weruva is clearly made with superior ingredients. I will still be monitoring my cat for any problems, but so far this food is working fine for him and I feel better knowing he is on a better quality food.<br /><br />At first my cat was hesitant to eat the Weruva food, but I believe that was simply because he wasn't used to the texture. The Weruva chicken is shredded into fine strips, rather than minced. My cat would drink the juices, as he had no problem with the flavor, but was reluctant to actually eat the chicken. So I had to mix it with the prescription food he had been eating before he would eat the Weruva food by itself. It is a good idea to mix the food with what your cat has been eating, anyway, so they can gradually get used to it. Now my cat doesn't hesitate and will eagerly eat the Weruva food.",1

138,"Reading the other reviews of this product is fascinating.  Bugs?  Dust?  Gooey messes?  Allergic reactions? My experience with Swheat Scoop has been, happily, quite different.  Heretofore, I've used clumping clay-based litters, most recently Arm & Hammer brand.  With all of them, though, I've observed that they are very dusty when being poured into the litter box, that they cake onto the cats' feet and are tracked through the house, and that they do little to mask the odor of urine or feces.  By contrast, Swheat Scoop has none of these drawbacks.<br /><br />After using a 15-pound box for the first time with two cats, I have observed that:<br /><br />- There is minimal tracking out of the litter box, and what there is is easily swept up, unlike clay litter which, when wet, sticks to the tile floor.<br /><br />- There is only a pleasant, natural odor which completely absorbs all urine and feces odors, making the litter box room much more pleasant.<br /><br />- There is no evidence of any dust whatsoever, even when pouring from the container into the litter box.<br /><br />- Clumping is satisfactory.  Sheat Scoop does not clump as tightly as clumping clay litters but is still easily scooped out of the litter box with a scoop designed for that purpose.  It does not adhere to the sides or the bottom of the litter box as clay litter does, and the box has stayed much, much cleaner than when it was filled with clay litter.  I realize that this directly contradicts some other reviewers' comments, but it is what I have observed.<br /><br />- Again in contradiction to several other reviewers' observations, no weevils or any other insect life form infested the box of Swheat Scoop.  It was perfectly lifeless!<br /><br />- Although the instructions advise acclimating cats to the new litter by putting a layer of the old litter to which they are accustomed on top, I switched the litter completely and suddenly, and both cats took to the Swheat Scoop immediately.  They had no adjustment problems whatsoever.<br /><br />- The instructions also advise that some household pets may look upon the wheat content as food and try to consume the litter.  However, my omnivorous canine, who would eat himself into oblivion if opportunity permitted, has never once attempted to nibble on the litter.<br /><br />In short, this is the cleanest, best-smelling, and most effective cat litter I have ever come across, and both cats took to it immediately.  I am thoroughly pleased with its appearance, odor, cleanliness, and performance. (And I can't believe that I'm actually writing a review of kitty litter, but this product is worth it!)  I'm not discounting the negative experiences which some other reviewers have reported, but I cannot explain them unless there are environmental conditions at work.  My first box of Swheat Scoop was purchased and used in semi-arid states low in humidity and with pretty low winter temperatures.  Were I in a wetter, warmer southern state, perhaps my experience and satisfaction with Swheat Scoop would have been different.",1
139,"My boston terrier/english bulldog puppy's coat became shiny on this food, his breath smelled good, his gas wasn't stinky, and the food appears to have excellent ingredients.  However, after over a month of eating Wellness, his stool never became firm (which it was on whatever cheap food he was eating at the breeders). It alternated between runny and mushy. I'd read similar reviews on various websites, but decided to try it anyway (everyone's experiences are different). Although I have no way of knowing this, I wonder if some of the fancier dogfoods overdo it with the flax and greentea---it would certainly give me the runs.  Anyway, I think it's a good food and may work well for some dogs, but we've had to transition off of it to Merrick puppy plate, which, although it has similar ingredients, seems to be firming up the poop.",1

141,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

If you want to try a box before you buy it in bulk here, I've found it at most health food stores, Fry's / Kroger's in their health food sections, and Sprouts.<br /><br />Even if you are hooked on the other stuff, give this a try, you might be pleasantly surprised. I had bought this for my parents and their verdict is: Dad loves it, Mom likes it.<br /><br />Update 6/6/09: I just responded with these comments in another review, and thought they might be helpful:<br /><br />I too would enjoy more berries in the cereal, but it would probably make the price astronomical, so I usually add a little of ""Just Tomatoes"" brand of freeze dried mixed fruit which is yummy and has a good mix of fruit - though I could do without the raisins, they're not so good freeze dried.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QV4"">Just Tomatoes Just Fruit Munchies, 8-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />They also have only blueberries<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGAJP0"">Just Tomatoes Just Blueberries, 8-Ounce Tub</a><br />plus strawberries, raspberries, apples, pineapple etc. just search ""just tomatoes"" - without quotes - in the grocery drop down in the search box.<br /><br />I first found them at my local upscale grocery store (in smaller sized containers) and they are a little less expensive here, but I also like to support the local store, so I buy them from both places.<br /><br />There is another brand that I haven't tried, but has gotten great reviews called Traverse Bay that has dried blueberries<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5YDO"">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7ELTM"">Traverse Bay Dried Blueberries, 4 lbs</a><br /><br />You don't need to use a whole lot in the cereal so they last for awhile. One tip is to keep them in the freezer so they stay crunchy.<br /><br />Hope this helps!",1

The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy.

151,"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.",1

153,"This is amazing.  I like it better than all other coconut oils.  Of course it tastes like coconut.  I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like ""nothing"".  I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people.  If you don't like coconut, find a different oil.<br /><br />You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product.  Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature.<br /><br />It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving ""cream"", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc.  Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for ""adult activities"" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible.<br /><br />If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed.

Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish.  (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.)<br /><br />I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils.  I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts.  I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff.<br /><br />I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid.

154,"Long time Oatmeal eater here.  I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey.  Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!",1

159,"McCann's (in the tin)  is nothing like the tasteless mush that passes for oatmeal in the U.S.. True, it does take 25 minutes and sometimes you need to fool with the water amount and/or the flame until you figure out what to do to get it exactly as you like -- too high a flame, for example, does away with the water before the oatmeal is completely cooked, but remember you don't want it to cook so long that the special consistency is lost. I've cooked it for years but even so when I took a can to our country place where we have a propane gas stove, it was as though I'd never made it before. However, the finished product is  well worth the time. Even unadorned or  with just a bit of grated nutmeg, it has a satisfying crunch and slightly nutty taste. My husband, based on bad childhood oatmeal memories, initially turned up his nose at the thought of eating oatmeal; he likes it so much he makes it for himself several times a week. Two of our younger grandkids accustomed to starting the day with cold commercial cereal ask for the ""special"" oatmeal when they visit. Additionally, it's substantial; a  serving at breakfast easily holds you till lunch time. PLEASE NOTE -- what I've written refers only to McCann's in the tin; I've never tried the flakes.",1

166,"Unfortunately most people are ill informed about vegan cats, including most veterinarians.<br /><br />Wild cats are in fact obligate carnivores. However, in domesticating the house cat and bringing it into our homes we have effectively removed the cat from its natural prey of mice, insects, birds, lizards, and other small creatures. During the past 100 years or so, as the human food industry was searching for a way to salvage and use all the waste materials from its processing lines, it came upon a wonderful solution. Lets boil it all up and dry it out and add it to the food we make for cats and dogs. As a result, the vast majority of commercial pet foods contain what are euphemistically referred to as the four D's, dead, dying, disabled, and diseased animals, along with other quite undesirable materials. Quite frankly, if you are feeding this junk to your pets, you are effectively poisoning them. We are seeing diseases in pets today that we have never seen before because of the wide variety of contaminated ingredients that are finding their way into the food we feed our companion animals. You know ""garbage in, garbage out!""<br /><br />Now the issue here is not meat; it is about providing all the essential and non-essential amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and vitamins and minerals that are bio-available to the particularly unique physiology of felids (cats). The quality, quantity, and availability of these nutrients can come from any source, and for those of us who are vegan, the best source is vegetable based.<br /><br />Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of cats around the world live quite well on one of the several available vegan cat foods that are recognized as nutritionally complete. I personally have had 3 1/2 years of experience in feeding the Evolution kibble product that this review is addressing. It is a high quality product that is AAFCO certified as nutritionally complete for all life stages in cats. Not only is this product safe to feed your cat, but if you follow the recommended feeding procedures, you will find many benefits to both your cat's health and your wallet.<br /><br />If you desire more detailed information, I invite you to do a google search on vegan cats. I would put my web page information about this issue on this review, but it is against the policy for writing reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Just for everyone's edification, I have researched this issue for well over 500 hours, read hundreds of technical papers, visited hundreds of web sites, and have made a commitment to specialize in feline nutrition as part of my Veterinary Technician studies. I probably know more about feline nutrition than 95% of all the vets in the world.<br /><br />My feline son is a vegan and will remain so because I am absolutely certain that his quality of life will be enhanced by his diet and that this choice will not be a detriment to his health.<br /><br />-------------------------------------<br /><br />Since writing this review in 2006 I have had a change in position about this particular product after 4 years of personal experience. The manufacturer of the Evolution foods was changing the formulation of the food on a regular basis and during that time I found that the Feline Kibble was not able to maintain the pH level in the urine of cats that was promised on the label and in their literature. At least that wasn't the case with my former feline son and my current feline son. As a result I can no longer recommend the use of Evolution Feline Kibble for male cats. Since urinary issues are different between male and female cats the Evolution Kibble MAY be satisfactory for feeding to female cats. Nutritionally the Evolution foods seem to be fine for nutrients but not necessarily adequate for maintaining the proper pH levels to avoid urinary issues for male cats.<br /><br />Consequently I am now recommending male cats use the Vegecat pH diet provided by Harbingers of a New Age. My son has been eating this food supplement in a specially prepared gluten formulation I created called a vegan feline roast. It is 62% protein, 33% fat, and 5% carbs and has a moisture content of about 60%. Almost a perfect combination of ingredients to mimic natural prey. My son finds this product to be very palatable and his urinary pH has been consistently at 6.4 for the three years that we have been producing and consuming this food. The drawback is that it takes about a half hour every 3 days to make the food and the cost is equivalent to a premium cat food. But on the other hand my son is trim, full of energy at 6 1/2 years, enjoys great health, no longer has urinary tract issues, and no other animal had to die in order to provide my son with life-giving nutrition.<br /><br />UPDATE:  4/17/11<br /><br />For those of you who are still considering feeding the Evolution kibble, please heed this warning.  Kibble is only 10% moisture content.  If you follow the directions given by the manufacturer to soak the kibble prior to feeding, you will end up with a mushy material that your cats may or may not like.  The danger in feeding the dry kibble is that your cat will eventually become so dehydrated that no amount of drinking will be sufficient to avoid hydration related illnesses.  Cats do not naturally drink water, they almost exclusively obtain all of their hydration from the food that they consume.  If they are eating something that only has 10% moisture, upon consumption the moisture that is contained within the digestive tract of the cat will be sucked into the food in order to give it enough fluidity to pass through the intestines.  This will often lead to gastro-intestinal diseases. Your cat will be constantly drinking water to make up for that deficiency, but no amount of drinking is enough to avoid the dehydration problem.  So please remember that the best source of moisture for your cat's health, comes from a wet food diet that is around 70% moisture.<br /><br />In October 2008 I wrote an article about vegan cats published in VegFamily magazine.  This information and more will help those who are interested in a vegan diet for cats understand more of the issues.<br /><br />UPDATE:  8/27/12<br /><br />My vegan feline son is now 8 years old and still maintains an extremely healthy life with absolutely no issues of any kind.  He has been using our Vegan Feline Roast product for the past 5 and 1/2 years and his lab tests indicate that his nutritional needs are being adequately met by his vegan diet.<br /><br />For those who are sceptical about a vegan diet for house cats, there is ample evidence that several vegan products are available to satisfy the nutritional needs of cats.  I am still not convinced that Evolution is a good product to feed based on my past history.  There are thousands of customers that seem to successfully feed the Evolution product; however, I believe that our Vegan Feline Roast Mix is a superior product that will yield far better results over the lifetime of feeding any house cat.  Our product is based on the Vegecat phi supplement offered by HOANA, which I have found to be an excellent product for hitting all of the missing nutritional elements that would otherwise come from meat.  The Vegecat product line has been successfully feeding thousands of cats over a 27 year period and we highly recommend the use of Vegecat for those people who wish to formulate their own vegan cat food.  The only difference between our food product and the HOANA vegecat product is that our product is a ready-to-make mix that has been specifically formulated for a high protein/high fat food that is easy to make and highly palatable to the vast majority of cats.<br /><br />I would caution people feeding the Evolution kibble to reconsider doing so.  The problem with kibble in general, not just the Evolution product, is the 10% moisture content of the food.  Cats that eat kibble exclusively will invariably become dehydrated and will not be able to consume enough water by drinking to avoid the condition.  Evolution kibble that is soaked with water prior to feeding, as recommended by the manufacturer, is an attempt to avoid this issue.  However, by soaking the product you will reduce the palatability quality to most cats and will make it harder for them to continue to want to eat the product.  This is a strategy to fix a problem that is inherent to the product itself.<br /><br />As time goes on, I become more convinced that using our Vegan Feline Roast product may in fact be a cure for diseases in cats like FLUTD and diabetes.  At some point in time I would like to perform a long term double blind scientifically significant study to support my empirical observations.  When my son started out 7 years ago eating Evolution kibble, he quickly developed a FLUTD condition, after 18 months of use, that cost $1500 at the vet to fix.  The last 5 1/2 years of eating nothing but our Vegan Feline Roast he has remained FLUTD free and maintains excellent health.  Just the savings alone from avoiding annual teeth cleaning has more than paid for itself in the use of our product.<br /><br />So my bottom line is to recommend not using Evolution Kibble in favor of either the HOANA vegecat supplement or our Vegan Feline Roast Mix.",1

If you're interested in poor quality with poor taste and poor texture this is for you.  I can get organic mac and cheese with whole wheat noodles and real, organic cheese for less than this item at the supermarket (or maybe even on Amazon).  All in in all, you can get 10 times the product for less any day.",0
170,"Kikkoman mirin is probably what's called mirin-fu chomiryo (literally mirin-like seasoning). It's certainly not hon mirin (true mirin). If you look at the ingredients list, you'll see a big give away: Rice, Water, **Corn Syrup**, Alcohol, Salt. I'm not even sure this is made with rice wine. It's got rice and (a very little) alcohol in it, but it's sweetened with corn syrup. That's not mirin.<br /><br />Real mirin is sweetened by rice that has been subjected to the Aspergillus oryzae fungus, which breaks down the rice starches into sugar. It's what's used in the production of sake. Mirin uses the same fungus to produce the unfermented sugars that sweeten this essential Japanese cooking wine.<br /><br />If you're looking for the real thing, go to an Asian market and check the labels. Anything with sugar or corn syrup in it isn't authentic. Eden Foods also makes a widely available and very good mirin made from organic brown rice, rice koji (Aspergillus oryzae), pure water and sea salt.<br /><br />(The salt in mirin sold in the US is not authentic either, it's added to calssify the wine as cooking wine, thereby avoiding alcohol taxes).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read the labels and opt for authenticity. You won't regret it.",1
171,"To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they ""source fresh fruit"" and that "" We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products.""  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together.",1
172,"With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!",1
173,"After looking at a site that referenced 5-hour energy and finding out that NALT (N-Acetyl, L-Tyrosine) was an ingredient, I went to wikipedia to find out the other ingredients and lo and behold all five major cognitive-enhancing supplements (I'm including the B-Complex Vitamins here)including in this drink were the four that constituted my core stack for mental-intensive tasks (I substitute Alpha-GPC for CDP-Choline on occasion, due to it's effectiveness at crossing the blood-brain barrier . The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"". ALL which can be bought cheap on here and combined at 1/5 the cost. Not to mention you can split the caff. tabs in half when you're already ""up"" and don't want to risk the anxiety that comes with a full tablet, which consists of 200mg of caffeine. Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

177,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!",1

179,"A lot of people have been posting about the near-expired dates on the coffee. First, I'd like to mention that this product is intentionally labeled to have a really short shelf-life, and not to ensure freshness.<br /><br />The funny thing about expiration dates is that for something like this, it honestly doesn't matter. I've gotten batches that are expired (for cheaper) and the taste is the same great amazing taste as it was when it was well within the ""Best Until"" range. Yes, I have taken two packs, one expired and one not expired, and they both are the same delicious taste.<br /><br />The reality is that expiration dates are a wonderful tool that make people throw perfectly fine food and go out and buy more. Especially with dairy products: If it's a few days over, most people will toss out cartons of perfectly good milk or eggs that could keep for another five weeks, which keeps people buying it more frequently. The fact is, if you would drink it without knowing the expiration date is past (it doesn't smell or look bad) then it's not only safe to eat, but a waste to toss.<br /><br />This isn't true for drugs, however. If your medicine says it's expired, it's expired. Also, condoms. Those do lose integrity over time.<br /><br />So, this is a product that intentionally has a very short shelf-life because it makes ridiculous people go, ""Oh, no, instead of getting it cheaper online and in bulk, I'll just buy a lot of more expensive smaller packs for more money."" Starbucks enjoys charging their consumers for their instant coffee like it's magical pixie dust, and the only way they can stop people from buying it from other cheaper sources is to give it a tiny shelf-life. Look at some of the other reviews, here. It's working!",1

Although the scientific results and brands were not released, I've found from several different sources that this brand is far higher than the others, contrary to the statement posted on the Nature's One website.<br /><br />**3/13/12 For anyone interested, we have officially switched to the Holle brand of infant formula. Our daughter has been on this formula for almost 2 weeks, and she took to it right away. There is plenty of information, along with user reviews from around the world, online.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is not available for sale here in the US.<br />Please see the source I have been ordering from in Germany that offers relatively moderate shipping fees in the comments.<br />If you have any questions about the Holle products, please leave a comment, and I'll get back to you at my earliest convenience.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I ordered this formula because my wife is starting back to school in a couple of weeks, and won't have the ability to breastfeed or pump as she has been doing. I have read much of the info from the manufacture's website, and the many online reviews. Even with the occasional constipation some users have had, we decided to give this a shot.<br /><br />Our 4 month old daughter (wow does time really fly with them) took right to it. My wife tasted the formula, and said it is sweet like breast milk tends to be. We had tried another brand since we get free samples, and it must have been awful. Our daughter didn't like it one bit.<br /><br />We haven't had an issue with constipation, however she is still receiving breast milk, which may be helping with that. We are hoping that my wife will be able to pump enough in the mornings and evening, before and after class, to keep a supply, and only really need to supplement with the formula, which is only twice a day currently.<br /><br />I also really like that the manufacturer is an advocate of breastfeeding, and that is why they label their products for 12+month infants.<br /><br />You also can't go wrong with the 3 pack price that Amazon offers. Plus is comes with free 2 day shipping using Amazon Mom Prime.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Our daughter is now on this formula exclusively. She hasn't had constipation issues as other reviews have mentioned. Her bowel movements are firmer, and more solid, which makes clean up easier, and still regular. I wouldn't say she has any pain associated from this though.<br /><br />She still also takes to it wonderfully. There was never any problem with her distinguishing between breast milk and this formula.<br /><br />As a note, Amazon's price on this only saves us 1 cent per can compared to the local Whole Foods price. However, we do not regularly shop at Whole Foods as it isn't very convenient for us. The 2 day shipping is great, and very convenient. Just make sure to stock up while Amazon has it in stock. They seem to sell out quite often.<br /><br />ANOTHER UPDATE: 11/6/11<br />The Amazon price has increased on the 3 pack of this formula. It is no longer feasible to buy from here, so off to Whole Foods we go. Somewhat disappointed, as Amazon was saving us money, and valuable time.",1
183,"I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.

That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, ""Weinbrand,"" since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Amazon has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift.<br /><br />The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates.

My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.",1
203,I will be honest. I have never tried Zevia and am hesitant to do so because if I do indeed like it I will not be able to AFFORD IT!!!! My husband drinks soda like water and I am trying to steer him in a more healthy direction; hence my wanting to try Zevia. Why is it that everything that is better for your health is so expensive?! I mean $24.00 for a case of soda is astronomical when you can buy a case of the popular brands for no more than $8.00. With the economy the way it is I will just have to wait until I land a better job so that I can afford to be more healthy!,0

207,"I purchased this from GoPicnic as part of a package for travel and purchased extras to ""try ahead of time.""<br /><br />This particular meal is both gluten-free and vegetarian. The GoPicnic Website also lists it as Halal and preservative free. It comes with a small fork as well as salt and pepper, so that you can eat it on its own either cold or hot. I tried it both ways and it was equally tasty.<br /><br />I love the fact that it includes suggestions inside of the package and for our first try I added chedder cheese and heated it, using it as a side dish with chicken. It was very filling on its own, and the cheese was a great complement.<br /><br />If you are eating it as a meal by itself, adding slices of cheese or a small can of tuna will increase the protein, however I would consider it an ample meal with a side of crackers or corn chips, or as it recommends on the side, over a dish of nachos!<br /><br />The packaging lists it as ""two servings,"" although on the go you will most likely want to eat it as a single serving. This would give you 10 grams of protein, 36 grams of carb (14 of which are fiber for a net carb count of 22 grams), and 10 grams of fat.<br /><br />Tasty, healthy, and nutritious. I'm looking forward to eating it again on our trip.<br /><br />*** The one thing I have not been able to confirm is whether this meal is TSA safe. Please be sure to check if you are intending to take it with you on an airline, since it would be very disappointing to have it confiscated by security.",1

I tried it side by side with locally distributed Coca Cola, and noticed it tastes like the Coca Cola I remembered as a child. The local Coca Cola does not compare. I attribute the difference mainly to the use of cane sugar in the Mexican product. The aroma of this product is better as is the taste. The greensish tinted bottle gives it a nostalgic feel, but it is the taste and aroma that sold me. Additionally, the local product was overly carbonated, perhaps to have a longer shelf life.

212,"Healthy Choice makes an excellent soup and this chicken with rice soup in a microwavable bowl is no exception. The soup is delicious and overall fairly healthy for you.<br /><br />I like that the soup provides a good deal of chicken, vegetables and even the rice tastes fresh! The broth is also very tasty. Healthy Choice makes a high quality chicken noodle soup than most other brands because they include chicken and rice while keeping limits on fats, sugars and cholesterol.<br /><br />One look at the ingredients shows us more positives: There are no trans fats and the soup has almost zero saturated fat. It is also extremely low in cholesterol. However, it does contain sodium (480 mg per serving) so if you need to watch your sodium intake please consider this before buying this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, sometimes the top lid is difficult to remove and then you have to handle the bowl very carefully to avoid spilling the soup. The soup is filled up almost to the brim of the bowl; and so it's easy to spill a little! The top lid is somewhat cumbersome and doesn't really help enough when it's on top of the bowl inside the microwave oven, either. The cover didn't completely cover the soup bowl in the microwave and some soup spilled inside the microwave. And yes, you DO need a solid surface on which you can open this container otherwise you are almost certain to have a spill because the soup bowl is filled completely.<br /><br />Overall, the soup itself is excellent. The packaging, on the other hand, is nothing special. The cover lid is cumbersome to remove and inside the microwave soup can spill out through the cover. I think that the packaging drives the cost of this soup higher than it otherwise might be. The packaging needs to be changed; perhaps Healthy Choice could make a slightly higher bowl so that the soup won't easily spill out when you remove the plastic lid.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for people who love chicken soup with vegetables and rice if they don't need to worry about sodium in their diets. If you are bothered by the packaging, however, then try another brand. Five stars for the actual soup combined with three stars for the packaging makes this a four star review.",1
213,"Rarely have I encountered a product that doesn't have at least ONE person who either thinks it's junk, or gives a (bogus) low review because the delivery guy accidentally dropped the package before leaving the item at the door.<br /><br />As of this moment, 100% of the people reviewing the Greenies PILL POCKETS have given them a five-star rating, and I'm enthusiastically joining the crowd!<br /><br />If you're a dog owner, you've almost certainly had to, at some point, give your dog a pill that he or she was reluctant to take. The usual remedy until now, (as suggested by our vet) was to simply shove the thing down the poor dog's throat, and then rub their neck to help the pill go down.<br /><br />Recently, one of our dogs --a large yellow lab named Chip-- was suffering from untreatable throat cancer, but he still needed to take a number of pills to make his final days a little more comfortable. The vet specifically mentioned AVOIDING the ""shove and rub"" technique as it would be very painful for the dog --who at that point was even reluctant to eat his regular food.<br /><br />Someone mentioned PILL POCKETS. We picked up a bag and lo and behold, they worked like a champ. Though Chip was still not really interested in eating a meal, the *very* meaty smell of the PILL POCKETS was irresistible to him, and he happily gobbled up his meds.<br /><br />Sadly, we lost Chip about a week later, but then our other dog developed a minor skin rash that required he take some antibiotics. Eubie is a Border Collie, and they tend to figure things out before you do --and we were astounded when he wolfed down his medicine and then looked at us as if to ask ""is that all --when do I get another?!""<br /><br />My technique for using the PILL POCKETS is to stuff the pill(s) inside, pinch off the open end --and then, using my palms, ""roll"" the pocket into a smooth, round ball. With Eubie at least, he loves the smell so much, that he simply swallows it whole.<br /><br />In fact, I discovered another great use for the PILL POCKETS and that is to take a rawhide bone and smear the nooks and crannies with a single pill pocket. Since they're kind of ""doughy"" in texture, they're perfect in this regard --and for a dog that will happily walk around the house with the rawhide bone for days without ever chewing on it, we've found that the ""pill pocket infused"" rawhide is something that he HAS to chew on. (In fact, he was SO focused on this task, that for the first time ever, he actually ignored the fireworks on July 4th.... it was truly amazing!)<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin",1
214,"I've been using rendered duck fat from another company that's 4 times as expensive but not any better.

218,"Quinoa is one of the healthiest grains you can eat - and one of the most delicious!  It cooks in less than 15 minutes, so you can make a fast dinner using it.  And how delicious it is!  Mmmmmmm!!!!  Softer than rice, it has a slightly sweet and nutty taste.  My favorite recipe is to cook it with a small onion, a tablespoon of butter, and a half cube of vegetarian boullion (or a half-teaspoon if using powdered boullion or fresh refrigerated type).  Bring the water to a boil, add the onion, butter, let boil for a minute.  Then add the quinoa.  Bring to boil again.  Add the bullion, and turn down to a low simmer for 10 - 15 minutes, and there you go!  A fantastic grain that leaves you feeling light and energetic.  As for Bob's products, they are always excellent.  Amazon's price is very good, especially if you live in a small town or out in the country, where it may be hard to get organic and specialty items like Bob's Quinoa.",1

I drank half the bottle before looking down and realizing that the black was not decorative packaging but actually the color of the water!  It doesn't taste like plain water, but not so unlike plain water that you think you are drinking something else...it tastes like water with a little extra mineral in it and it is not sparkling, by the way.<br />I'll have to say I was surprised to find myself liking it.  I had a mild sore throat (cold maybe coming on?) and a painful cold sore starting in my mouth.  The blk water made the area a little numb/tingling (like hydrogen peroxide does when put on a cut to disinfect) at first and then...after a minute or so the cold sore didn't hurt and my throat didn't either anymore.  I'm not one for miracle cures, etc, but this made me feel pretty good.<br />I don't know anything about Fulvic Acid, so I looked it up and it seems people are pitching it as the new ""superfood"" supplement; that said it's hard to find much factual information on how exactly it is helpful or not for humans.",1

223,"I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states ""No fillers.""  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is ""vet-recommended"" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes ""Hill's Science Diet"" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.

228,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",0

230,"Pet food has an immense range of quality that we like to roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage; (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product; and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises.  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long):  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",1
231,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

It is the simplest thing I've found when I'm really jonesing for some great curry - add some coconut milk (the real thing, not that lite junk), a little fish sauce, some sugar, and whatever veggies you have around - red bell pepper, carrots, zucchini, a nice fat serrano chili - maybe a little chicken - ladle it over some brown rice - voila!

233,"Miracle Rice is amazing! I added it to chicken vegetable soup, and also created a delicious dish of ground beef, fresh basil, garlic, onion and the rice. The rice really doesn't have any flavor at all - it just adds volume to your dish, making it more filling, but still with a very light consistency. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture - in my opinion, less like rice and more like little pearls, or Israeli cous cous - not chewy at all, just blends lightly and beautifully into your dish.  It's so easy to imagine many recipes to which the rice could be added to increase volume guilt-free, without adding any calories or fat.  This is truly a miracle product!",1

244,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.",1
245,"I've been eating Linketts since I was a very young child since my Grandparents are vegetarians, and I LOVE them.  I will admit it is a very aquired taste.  I even got my boyfriend started on them and he loves them too.  =D<br /><br />I would suggest finding a store that sells them by the can before you invest in a whole case.  I know that you can find them at Raley's on the West Coast.  If local health food stores don't carry them check to see if there is a Seventh Day Adventist Church near you.  The SDA Church typically has a book center that sells the Worthington/Loma Linda products.<br /><br />Edit:  I have also found Linketts in the natural food section of Kroger's here in Texas as well.  Another Edit.. My local Kroger has stopped carrying Linketts.  =(",1
246,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",1

252,"Pet food has an immense range of quality that we like to roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage; (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product; and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises.  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long):  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",1
253,"I returned to work when my little guy was 3 months old and by 5 months I had used ALL my freezer stash.  My baby had only had breastmilk but I couldn't keep up with what they fed him at daycare.<br /><br />He eats 16oz while I am at work.  I was pumping 3-4 times at work for 20 minutes at a time and only getting 2 1/2 oz per session.  I was so frustrated and exhausted!  I tried everything: more water, more frequent pumping sessions, more frequent nursing while with the baby, I even took a nursing weekend where all I did was nurse and pump and rest but I still couldn't get more than 3 oz per pumping session.<br /><br />I started with 5 cups of tea per day.  I don't like the smell or flavor of black licorice so I was worried that I would have to gag this tea down...it isn't pleasant but it is tolerable.  I can even drink it without adding sugar, honey, or milk but it will never be a drink I like or want.<br /><br />Day one I really didn't see any change at all.<br /><br />Day two I pumped 3 times and got 11 oz which was the most I had gotten at work in weeks.<br /><br />Day three I pumped 3 times at work and each time I got 5 oz or more.  I ended the day with 17 oz and was thrilled!  That evening I nursed my son when we got home but could tell I wasn't empty so I pumped right after nursing and got another 2oz.  That night I leaked through the night and had to change my shirt...now I don't drink any tea after 6 pm.<br /><br />I've been using the tea for only ten days now and have started a new freezer stash that is currently at 20 oz.  The peace of mind is great, knowing I have extra.  I am consistently pumping 5oz per session and getting the extra 2-3oz after my nursing session with my son at 5:30 and sometimes I pump at 8 p.m. after nursing and get another 2-3 oz.  As an added bonus, my little guy was still waking every two hours until I started drinking this tea.  The past three nights he has slept 4 hours at a time.",1
254,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.",1
255,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it.",1

258,"Oh, c'mon grow up...I happen to call Hershey Kisses, Hershey Squirts...y'know, as in small...which exactly what Hershey Kisses are; small yet incredibly satisfying and I just bought myself a 25lb case to prove how much I love them.

As I'm sure most people agree they can eat this in one sitting much like any other candy bar out there and maybe most can it eat more than once a day.  What's deceptive is the nutrition for it!

263,"Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them ""adverts""), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as ""Umami"". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.",1

265,"I converted to drinking only loose leaf tea last year and gave this gift pack a try. While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.<br /><br />For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that's not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:<br /><br />* China Black Tea<br />* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)<br />* Oolong<br />* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea<br />* Yunnan Pu-erh<br />* Jasmine Tea<br />* White Tea<br />* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum<br />* Lychee Black Tea<br />* Rose Black Tea<br />* Rose Green Tea<br />* Osthsmum Green Tea<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'd like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn't such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.<br /><br />You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can't expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn't know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas! It may cost a little more, but I think one would be much better served by ordering samples from a company like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YT18B4"">Heavenly Teas</a> or Adagio.",1
266,"Use with caution. When my baby was 5 weeks old I noticed that my milk supply was decreasing. I was taking 2 pills 3 times a day for about a week when I started felling really sick. I head strong headaches, I was weak and I had problem with breathing. My baby had a cough and was spitting up milk. She could not swallow, the mucus in her mouth was very thick. I learned from my doctor that fenugreek has very dangerous side effects: it can cause asthma;  reduces blood glucose levels which means it is not right for diabetics; promotes menstrual flow and can make yor menstrual cycles abnormal. I spent money on pills, teas, drops and my milk supply did not increase at all. I can breastfeed my baby only once a day now. I am happy with what I can give her although I see clearly that she hates formula.

268,"If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />The ""I Love You"" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection:<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's R礙verie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon.

270,"I got this for soap making. I'm a beginner so I can't really say anything about the quality.<br /><br />I received my bottle today with it in solid form. Granted its around 45 degrees outside, so it was most likely becoming a solid. I guess I'll just have to keep it warm to let it go into liquid form.<br /><br />ALSO the biggest complaint I have besides it being in complete solid form is that there's a huge bubble meaning its definitely not a full one quart as advertised. On top of that the bottle seems incredibly cheap.<br /><br />We'll see how the quality is when I start making soap.",0

273,"This is the first time I've purchased ""Dutch process"" cocoa, and I have to say, it is delicious! It is rich and mild, lacking the bitterness of regular cocoa powders. I bought it with no particular purpose in mind (I don't bake), just looking for ways to add more cocoa into my diet to get that great chocolate taste as well as the healthy antioxidants it provides. I've been enjoying experimenting mainly with adding it to hot beverages such as coffee or coffee substitutes. Often I don't even bother to sweeten these beverages - the mild flavor of this cocoa allows me to enjoy its natural chocolate flavor unsweetened. I even added a big spoonful to my oatmeal recently, along with everything else I normally add, and that was a treat! I'm looking forward to finding more ways to work it into my diet.",1
274,"Sure, Sarah Lee and the pholks at Philips think this baby produces the best coffee you'll ever taste.  It doesn't.  The snotty coffee folks, like myself, roast our own coffee and it is utterly superior.  However it is a royal PITA to tote fresh beans into the office and I'm the only one willing to go to that much trouble for coffee in my office.<br /><br />To solve this little problem, I purchased a Senseo and these pleasant Douwe Egberts Dark pods!  It's a sturdy machine, completely employee-proof, and quite tidy.  The coffee it produces is far better than anything that comes in a can and certainly will give Starbucks a run for their $6 venti's.<br /><br />Think of the DE pods as an easy way to get fresh, hot, pleasant coffee in about 30 seconds.  Use two pods, one dark and one medium for a fuller flavor profile or, if you're a low-caf freak, do one decaf and one caf.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that you've gotta pre-warm the mug you're using if you like hot coffee-and the best way to do this is with some leche in the microwave.  One final tip which out to assuage some of the folks who think the DE's are weak:<br /><br />Run a few seconds of hot water through the machine without a pod inside.  This gets the metal plates wet and hot.  A good thing.  Put your pods on the wet plates and close the machine.  Let it sit for a few seconds.  This lets the coffee get wet and swell a bit.  This is called pre-infusion in the espresso trade and if you pull your 8 oz of pleasure now, it will taste pretty darned good.<br /><br />-J",1

277,"WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch.  So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases.  Whay are they eatting...?  I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.",0

279,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly.",1

284,"****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E"">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.",1

293,"When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)",1

295,"Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product.  Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol.  After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions.  I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.

Many of us take in more iron than is considered healthy for our specific needs.  What your physician will tell you about this issue may be surprising.<br />(3) Grain. If we are allergic to wheat, we need to pay attention to the label.  Also there is corn in the form of fructose.  What we are getting is highly refined grain products when whole grain would be better for our health by providing fiber.<br /><br />With the price out of the range of what we usually spend on breakfast foods, I don't find it a good value.",1
300,"I do like my coffee on the Dark end of the roasting scale, and this offering from Timothy's delivers.  It is a nice smooth, smoky blend with even a hint of crema at brewing.  It also holds up well to cream if that is your preference.  The Extra Bold delivers the added punch that I routinely seek in my coffee, although I must admit that the 'Espresso' name is a bit misleading, as I have yet to find a K-Cup that delivers the full zing of a shot of espresso.  Either way, in the K-Cup genre, this one is among my favorites!  Give it a go!<br /><br />Pricing here at Amazon is excellent - just wish they offered the variety of makers that I have found at other online sources...",1
301,"I think anything that makes light of cigarette smoking is disgusting!  I've watched two close friends die horrible deaths related to their inability to quit smoking.  I recall puffing on the candy cigarettes and thinking it made me cool like a grown up, like my parents...  Then I recall how ""cool"" it was to smoke as a teenager in high school.  Took me 14 years to quit!  I have watched two people die from smoking... One went through being horribly cut open to remove a cancerous upper part of one of her lungs, only to go back to smoking a year later.  Another had emphazema (spelling?) from it and die a long painful suffocating death.  There's nothing ""cool"" about candy cigarettes or anything that would make light of such a horrible addiction!",0
302,"I have made every effort to NOT buy/feed anything made in China to my pet. I researched these duck/sweet potato treats before finally deciding to buy them. Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages. Just another reason why I don't hesitate to purchase from amazon. They truly have great customer service....rare these days.",1
303,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI"">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y"">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a> but no more bitter.<br /><br />If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2"">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot</a>.<br /><br />In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a> is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup.

304,"I tried this stuff at a suggestion of a friend that does not know how to read labels. She told me how wonderful this stuff is and that it has a whole lot less sodium than soy sauce. My husband has high blood pressure so I am always looking for ways to reduce sodium in his diet. We were in the store together and in a rush so I put a bottle in my cart without reading the bottle.<br /><br />As I said, my friend does not know how to read labels as a serving of Braggs is only 2.5 ml (one half of a teaspoon) and it has 160 mg of sodium. If you use it like soy sauce, you would probably use about a tablespoon (15 ml) which has 960 mg of sodium. A tablespoon of reduced sodium soy sauce has 530 mg of sodium - a little more than half of the same amount of Braggs and it tastes MUCH better. (If you want to do further math, 2.5 ml or 1/2 teaspoon of reduced sodium soy sauce contains 88.3 mg of sodium compared to the 160 mg in the same amount of Braggs)<br /><br />I will stick to my reduced sodium soy sauce. It tastes better and it has MUCH less sodium than the same amount of this stuff. My husband and son won't touch this disgusting stuff. I used it for a while putting half this garbage on my food and half soy sauce, but I couldn't take it any longer.  After sitting in my fridge for almost a year, I finally dumped it down the kitchen sink.",1

I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their package...Boy was I wrong!<br />I took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth, it also left the other way! Yuck! It tastes like really sugary old coconuts. I then looked at the ingredients and see ""premium coconut water from concentrate, natural flavors.""<br />I just don't get it: Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottle--and charge more for it!? Am I missing something?<br />The taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation. There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco, one, on the market, so why settle for something from concentrate, pay more for it, and hurt the planet with more plastic?",1

I don't post reviews for entertainment purposes as you seem to be evaluating and insulting comments posted. Before you judge someone from a petty post of review please keep in mind it does not give you the person's lifestyle nor psychological origins.

I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee.",0

322,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.",0

I'm afraid that my drain will stop up again just after the two year shelf life has expired and I will be forced to purchase a new case.

What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.

337,"Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch.<br /><br />What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!)<br /><br />I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic...<br /><br />Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market.<br /><br />I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar.",1

They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health.",0

353,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0
354,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the ""feeding instructions"" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list.",1

357,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.",1

374,"I am a ramen lover and have tried hundreds of varieties over the years, including my time in Japan, the land of endless ramen varieties. Nong Shim (Korean) is a long-time favorite and among the top 3 makers on my list. Their noodles are heartier and more delicious than everybody else's, mostly because they use better ingredients. The texture is firmer and more elastic, even retaining their chewy mouth-feel over time, unlike other noodles that quickly become mushy. If you're used to bargain basement brands like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061I6UE"">NISSIN TOP RAMEN</a>, do yourself a favor and try a Nong Shim.<br /><br />Among the higher quality ingredients that Nong Shim puts in here are ginger and shrimp extracts, beef and pork bone stock, and beef tallow. Beef tallow is the same stuff that makes McDonald's french fries so tasty.<br /><br />Pros<br />+ very tasty, spicy, and filling<br />+ excellent texture to vegetable seasoning pack (dried cabbage, carrots, onions, mushroom). I can actually taste the veggie bits.<br />+ 0mg cholesterol and no trans-fats<br /><br />Cons<br />- 500 calories in 1 pack. 160 of which are fat calories<br />- 40% of your daily saturated fat intake<br />- EXTREMELY SALTY: 94% of your daily sodium intake if you drink the soup<br /><br />Despite directions for boiling the noodles for 3 minutes, it can be prepared with just boiling water and a bowl. I made some with hot water from the office Flavia machine (coffee and tea maker) and waited 5 minutes.<br /><br />Because of the very high sodium and fat content, instant ramen should not be eaten often. But in a pinch (either due to lack of time, money, cooking skills, or all 3), ramen can provide a quick and filling meal. It is very easy to add vegetables and leftovers to it to mitigate the saltiness and provide better nutritional value. Ramen alone is just calories, fat, and salt and offers little nutrition. The powder packet packs a punch, and half a pack or less is sufficient for full flavor and to reduce the sodium level.<br /><br />Canned corn can be added (a popular topping in Japan), soft boiled egg, shredded green or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I02JBY"">Chinese/Nappa cabbage</a> or other vegetables, kimchi, spring onions, boiled shrimp or fish fillet, or whatever you like. The soup packet can also be used to make a pot of spicy soup, as you would use a soup mix or bouillon cube.<br /><br />Instant ramen is unhealthy, because they are fried in palm oil or some other fat, then dried and packaged.

Most people assume that if peanut butter is labeled ""natural"" that the only ingredients are peanuts (though some manufacturers add a little salt to their natural peanut butter, too).

I don't believe most people would think that something made from peanuts would ""naturally"" contain palm oil.

378,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables.

379,"You want to remove the sugar from peanut butter not the fat. And honestly this tastes bad in comparison.<br /><br />Roughly 50 percent of the fat in peanuts is monounsaturated. Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol (""good"" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.<br /><br />Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives.",0
380,"This is a fairly decent, commercial berbere mixture.  It has a fair bit of heat, owing to a large amount of cayenne/red pepper flakes (some of which seemed to have missed the grinder).  The balance in flavors isn't what you would expect from a fresher product or if you ground/toasted your own spices but it gets the job done particularly if you like your wats spicy.  However, for the price this isn't a good value.  The American Spices Berbere sold here has a deeper, balanced flavor profile and is vastly cheaper than this product.",1
381,"I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts.<br /><br />Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting ""burnt"" or ""too roasted"".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here.",1
382,"This tastes like real chocolate milk!  I've tried Slim-Fast, Muscle Milk, and other protein shakes, but I can't stand anything that has sucralose, aspartame, or any other artificial sweetener - they leave a nasty after-taste.  Orgain doesn't have any of that artificial stuff and it tastes great.",1

384,"I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.",1
385,"Sure wish I had researched cacao before purchasing $50 worth of nibs and powder.  For some reason I expected the nibs to be like chocolate chips without the sweetness.  It's like eating wood chips or something.  The powder is delicious, but I am now reading article after article about the negative effects of raw cacao stemming from the theobromine, caffeine, etc.  It's a powerful stimulant, not unlike a drug.  After spending the last few months cleansing, losing 25 pounds and switching to a mostly raw food diet, I feel like I've backslid into my old addictions to chocolate and caffeine.  Warning to others before you spend your hard-earned cash!",0
386,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together.  I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store.",1
387,"I have tried a lot of olive oils in the past, and being on a tight budget, I try to stay in the lower price range category. As you can imagine, I've ended up with some really lacking oils.

Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the size, no more trying to find a cabinet space tall enough for a tall bottle of oil.

389,"Being gluten intolerant it was really nice to see that Pamela's has put out a GF type clif bar (best analogy I had for it). Oddly enough, it does taste like a lighter version of a clif bar (which are usually very dense). Mind you, it would take two of these to fill me like a clif bar does.<br /><br />It's about 2/3rd's the size of a clif bar, it's loaded with oats (this is the first thing you taste) and chocolate chips (which is about the last thing you taste). They are moist and chewy like a soft cookie. About a medium sweetness compared to a regular cookie.<br /><br />Per bar: calories (180), fat (9 gr), carbs (23 gr), fiber (2 gr), and protein (2 gr).<br /><br />Ingredients: GF oats, organic agave, brown rice flour, white rice flour, sweet rice flour, tapioca starch, xanthan gum, organic chocolate chunks (organic natural evaporated can sugar, organic cocoa paste, organic cocoa butter, non-GMO soy lecithin/emulsifier, gluten-free organic vanilla) coconut sugar, monounsaturated safflower oil, organic eggs, almonds, coconut, chia seeds, natural flavors, sea salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />They do note on the packaging that there may be traces of milk, nuts, peanuts or soy because of what they're processed on.<br /><br />Overall, they're pretty darn good.  I do taste a bit of baking soda (but I think that's me, I'm pretty sensitive to it) at the end of a bite, but the oats really are the main taste.<br /><br />As someone who eats gluten free would I eat these if I was out and about and had to take a break quickly?<br /><br />Yeah, I would.<br /><br />They're like a soft, oaty cookie, easy to take, good ingredients, and they do taste quite nice. I'll buy them again easily.<br /><br />If I had to pick between a clif bar and Pamela's Whenever Bars. I'd take Pamela's.",1

401,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.",0

I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of amazon, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag.  1) that has nothing to do with amazon, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.  It's misleading to people looking for products when something has 2 stars because someone got an expired bag from A DIFFERENT STORE.<br /><br />My dogs love this food, and I don't think I'll ever switch.

In fact, to<br />get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup.<br />This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also<br />limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.  <p> I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with<br />the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack<br />of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to<br />pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a<br />huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some<br />watered-down version of the real thing.<p> Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee<br />I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody<br />else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.

413,"A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

However we did eat lemons before and after, and the lemons were quite pleasant to eat after you had dissolved the cardboard pellet on your tongue.  Regular pop, beer, and other foods were disgusting after eating the cardboard pellet though.  Cool for a novelty item at a party when you want to sit around and eat lemons, but I don't see much use for it other than that.

423,"I was terribly excited when I heard that Nescaf&eacute; had finally decided to just touch on the idea of carrying a wide array of flavors and intensities for straight espresso (I've always been so jealous of Nespresso's collection of capsules) by introducing a new single-shot Intenso. As I've been stuck making double-shots of their fairly disappointing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA"">Espresso</a> option for ages, I've decided to do a little comparison in reviewing this new and exciting addition.<br /><br />This is what we're working with: the Espresso has 6g of coffee in each capsule, while the Dark Roast Caff&eacute; Grande has 10g. As I noted in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O"">Latte Macchiato</a> review: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee with the final shot sitting at no more than 35mL. The Espresso's instructions recommend ending up with 60mL of liquid, which seems to be a light amount of coffee for so much water (the Dark Roast doesn't do much better, recommending 200mL for 10g). For my taste-tests, I was able to pump out a fairly heavy 50mL single-shot espresso, while I kept the Dark Roast to about 150-160mL<br />(NOTE: the tips I give in the previously mentioned Macchiato review for really squeezing every mg of coffee out of these capsules I have a feeling only work with the Dolce Gusto machines that allow you to completely control the flow; while my machine has that ball-point silver lever pointing up out of the head of the dispenser (like the Melody 2 and Circolo), it seems the machines Nescaf&eacute; just released this past month (specifically the Creativa) are somewhat automated).<br /><br />Right off the bat, as I dispense the Grande I notice the thicker, creamier color and texture of the coffee, which it retains for a good 30 seconds until it settles into a deep brown with even less noticeable light passing through (compared to the Espresso). Even though my pour started pushing 160 mL, the thickness is far greater than the Espresso, with absolutely no hint of water. Literally, the liquid itself feels heavier and richer in your mouth. The Espresso just pales in comparison in regard to taste, aroma, and texture. I'm definitely not an expert when it comes to pinpointing descriptive flavors in espressos, but I'd say the espresso here has something between a sweet and bitter dominating taste. On the other hand, the Grande lacks any resemblance to the Espresso, and if anything I'd say there's a warm, spicy flavor that mixes quite well with the overall dark roast qualities.<br />Ofcourse, to those who know anything (and definitely more than me) about coffee, you might just say, 'Well, you're comparing a dark roast to a regular espresso'. Yes, I guess I am, and thus I should expect these differences. However, for the past three years now Nescaf&eacute; has only had one option when it came to a strong single-shot, the Espresso (the other choices were Caff&eacute; Lungo and then the Americano, both of which got further and further from deep and strong drinks). So, I guess giving this new Caf&eacute; Grande Intenso a try has ultimately given me a worthwhile competing option for the espresso-based choices. And I can finally enjoy a drink from my machine that only requires one capsule (the espressos could only do the trick in double-shots). For those of you who've been in a similar situation, this review should give you an idea of what to expect (and what you're missing out on!) with this new choice.<br /><br />As usual, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the Subscribe and Save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through Subscribe and Save), AND factoring in the 5 (sometimes 10) award points you get with every box (with which you may eventually redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 6 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br /><br />Nescaf&eacute; has finally entered the realm of differing strengths and flavors for its espresso line, and those who felt the brand's mild espressos just weren't quite hitting the spot, this is a must-have and will easily be my go-to single-shot drink from now on!",1

435,"Well, now I'm totally confused.  Thought these totally eliminated the metal factor in cans [aside from the waste factor as well after opening].  I naturally assumed that the tubes were all plastic as many tubes are for other things, and that's why it survives in the fridge.  Where do you store the rest of the tubes before using, before opening.  Is it safe to be even IN the metal before open as CANS are not after an expiration date?  This is a lot of money to spend all at once on tomato paste not knowing if even ""IT"" will go bad.  Rachael Ray's and other cooks buy their supplies almost daily, not in `bulk' so that's fine for them but not for me, I always buy in bulk, not shopping often.  Another suggestion is to flatten out the paste in a zip lock bag, freeze, then break off portions as used, being thin enough it's easy, OR freeze portions in ice cube tray then put into zip locks when totally frozen, or on any surface temporarily also putting into zips when frozen.  But that also can be a pain, having to do that all the time.  Seriously considering whether to get these, especially knowing they're metal tubes or even lined with metal.  Can't find in any stores in NYC and getting very frustrated for a long time since I don't travel around to markets.  I have many little cans of Paste always but think, ""ahhh, why open one just for this"" or for that and getting fed up not using them.  Just threw out another remainder of 8 oz. can which I thought I'd use soon, but didn't and forgot about, in fridge otherwise I would have put the whole thing [in an empty marjorine cup] into the freezer for when I `felt' like making portions but forgot, therefore another almost full can into the trash.  Enough already with the cans.  It's 2010 and they should be more readily available, but guess the manufacturers love this 'can' game to induce more waste, therefore more sales.  Thought the tubes were the answer, but now this makes me wonder about the metal in the tubes as well.  I don't use things up that quickly for even the tubes to go fast,  but thought they were at least safe.",0
436,"I thought I was doing the right thing by buying organic and thought Similac was a brand I could trust to be good for baby.

It is the only major brand of organic formula that is sweetened with cane sugar, or sucrose, which is much sweeter than sugars used in other formulas.<br /><br />No health problems in babies have been associated with Similac Organic. But to pediatricians, there are risks in giving babies cane sugar: Sucrose can harm tooth enamel faster than other sugars; once babies get used to its sweeter taste, they might resist less sweet formulas or solid foods; and some studies suggest that they might overeat, leading to rapid weight gain in the first year, which is often a statistical predictor of childhood obesity.",1

439,"Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O"">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.

It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.

I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly.",1
453,"When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended.",1
454,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.",1
455,"I am a cake decorator who has been struggling to create vibrant icing and fondant colors without using a ton of coloring. The Americolor soft gel colors are amazing!!

456,"I have taken Juice Plus for about 5 years now.  Ever since I started taking it, I feel better, I look better and very rarely get sick.  I had run out about 4 months ago and within those four months of not taking it, I got a cold twice.  That's proof enough for me.  I don't eat enough fresh fruit and vegetables (I wish I did) and Juice Plus is a great supplement.  I have noticed though, that when I'm taking Juice Plus I actually crave the real thing more.  That is another thing I like about it!  AND...there are no strange ingredients!",1
457,"I am a regular subscriber of this ""Jack Link's"" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10.

458,This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate.  Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers!  Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN!  Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers?  I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper.,0

460,"Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell",1
461,"I checked several sites trying to find the ingredient list for this product before I purchased it, but couldn't find it.  Unfortunately this product contains many artificial ingredients and aspartame!  We made drinks with this once (my husband made them) before we read the ingredients.  The taste was pretty good, but left that aspartame aftertaste in our mouths.  If you don't care about your health or putting chemicals in your body, then this would be a good product for you.  Wish I could find a more wholesome substitution.",1
462,"As a consumer, I've been alarmed at how quickly food prices have soared, including cheese and similar dairy products. Also, a power outage last winter convinced me that it would be good idea to have some items on hand which could be used to create cheese sauces, perhaps if we had to use alternate ways of cooking, such as the fireplace.<br /><br />This produce exceeded my expectations. We not only have extra for emergency use but I've found all sorts of ways to use it weekly. It is the ONLY cheese powder which my family truly loves on popcorn, neither too salty or bland. It adds just the right touch.<br /><br />When it comes to adding an accent to my homemade white sauces or giving some zest to buttered broccoli, the nice cheese flavor is perfect. Try adding it to melted butter and some garlic as a spread for toast. The possibilities are limited only by your cookbooks and imagination.<br /><br />Also, this is an item that can be used by both beginners and professional cooks. You really can't go wrong by having some of this in your pantry and the ingredients are far healthier than the typical Cheese product sold at a local grocery store. Unless you want to subsist only on peanut butter sandwiches for two weeks (we thought we might have to do that during the winter at one point, car stuck in garage, roads icy and temperatures below freezing), this is a nice, reassuring cheese powder to keep in your pantry and versatile enough to add to popcorn, liven up sauces and keep vegetables from being boring.",1
463,"These are Turkish apricots that differ from varieties found in the U.S.  Dried Turkish apricots are moister and thicker and have a somewhat tangy taste.  Since these apricots are unsulphured, they are brown.  (Sulphur is used manly to make fruits look more attractive.  Sulphured apricots are yellow, just as sulphured ""golden"" raisins are.)<br /><br />Any bag of dried fruit (organic or not) will most likely have a piece or two that is drier and tougher than the rest. Made in Nature is no different.<br /><br />I find the fruit to be mostly sweet and chewy.  This is a good mid-day snack.  Dried apricots can also be finely chopped and cooked with oatmeal.  The reasealable bags are terrific. I will continue to purchase these as the price is lower than health food stores and shipping is free on orders of $25 and up.",1

468,"I have never written a review before but I always consult Amazon.com reviews before buying a product so thought I would give back at least once. I bought this product BEFORE I thoroughly researched it due to lifelong problems related to a hormonal imbalance and was soooo excited I just bought what I thought would be good; raw and organic. I took this product for 3 days until I broke out in hives. I only took 1/2 tsp day one and 1/4 tsp days 2 and 3. I got the hives day 2 but was hoping they were not related to the Maca (they were). So.... I researched more and there is one very informative forum I found on google (hard to find and not sure if I'm allowed to refer it or not but here it is but FINISH reading to the bottom or you will not try this product ever): [...]. There are a bunch of websites and some scientific reviews, but long story short, it appears that Maca MUST be eaten pre-cooked (gelatinized) to obtain therapeutic benefits and to alleviate potential problems related to digestion (when eaten raw) and possible toxicity (raw) the way the native Puruvians have done for thousands of years to the present (cooked). There are studies that show ingesting raw Maca is worse than not adding it to the diet at all. Based on what I've read you need to start SLOWLY with the dosage and adjust it according to your body's needs, then take a break from it occasionally or it appears to lose potency. If improper dosages are taken it exacerbates the imbalance/symptoms. There are (reportedly) many benefits of Maca on the entire Endocrine system and I still have high hopes so ordered from another company who doesn't sell raw Maca due to the reasons above. I believe Navitas also has a gelatinized version of the Maca but I bought one with DIM to prevent the overproduction of bad estrogen which can cause cancer in people with a family history. Hope this helps!",1

Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods.

477,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand簧 Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.

Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",1

480,"If you want to find a good flavor substitute for maple syrup, barley malt, or brown rice syrup, this will do nicely. I use Madhava's agave nectar in my baked goods all the time, and am always pleased with the results. At the time I'm writing this, Amazon was out of stock as a vendor. However, when it was in stock, it was priced well for the 2-pack.<br /><br />Other than baking, I've used it to top waffles, pancakes, and in small doses (1/2 teaspoon) added it to oatmeal. A little goes a long way.<br /><br />Using agave nectar: Use 1/3 to 1/2 less agave nectar than you would another sweetener (depending on your taste and the recipe. Recipes with dried fruit need much less), cut the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F; if there is oil in the recipe, cut it by 1/3 (alternately, use a tablespoon or two of sifted coconut flour to absorb more of the liquid -- just don't use too much or your recipe will be dry). Additionally, when baking, make sure to mix it with the wet ingredients prior to adding it to the dry. Most bakers might already know this, but remember to read recipes first because sugar is typically added with dry ingredients (unless beaten with butter first).<br /><br />Agave nectar does not crystalize like other sugars do, so you won't be able to substitute it for corn syrup in making hard candy. However, I highly recommend it for baking. It makes everything moister.<br /><br />If you are looking for less caramel flavor, you'll need to use the light version of this product (equally good in all applications).",1

Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.

They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more.

It is out of this world on cottage cheese, sounds like a strange combo but I haven't tried anything that it tasted so good on, the cool of the cottage cheese, the heat of the chili sauce, yum!<br /><br />It does have a good bit of heat to it. I have to have something close by to drink because it does burn the tongue a little.<br /><br />I'm addicted now and will be a lifelong lover of this chili sauce.

486,"This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via ""Subscribe & Save"" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.  It doesn't take a college education to know that's a deal!",1
487,"I absolutely love Amazon and practically 'hang out' on Amazon like some people do on Facebook - LOL! That being said, I really enjoy reading the reviews and the comments of fellow Amazoners and learn so much by doing so. I really appreciate the information that other reviewers include and when I have found a particular reviewer that I recognize over and over again, I have clicked on their profile to read more about them and about what other items they have reviewed and BOY has that been fun!<br /><br />And that is precisely how I stumbled upon this Amazing Grass Green Superfood mix!<br />I was reading the profile of another reader and she raved about it. Well, any time I am out of my green powder, I order a different brand. This way, I am always using a different product and can try them all out and see which one I really do like the best and will stay with. As timing would have it, I was almost out of the one I was using, and saw this review, and ordered it!<br /><br />I signed up for the Auto-delivery (as you can cancel at any time) and it reduced the price as well as free shipping - yay! But, the real test was in the flavor, and it's blendability (new word?). It shakes up well (shake, not stir), and the taste is pretty good. I add it to smoothies, or drink plain in water or juice and like it either way. It seems to be economically doable for me, possibly lasting 60 days, so that is a better deal than most out there.<br /><br />I felt better immediately after drinking it - with more energy - probably due to the Maca. Maca is something you want to research before taking, and certainly before ever giving to children. I have some Maca in a bag, and when I have added only a tiny bit of it to a smoothie - I didn't like the way it made me feel at all, and it made my heart go a little crazy, so IMO, be cautious.<br />This, however, gave me a burst of good-feeling energy without the heart palpitations of other ill-effects, so I was happy.<br /><br />All in all, I think I have found my favorite green drink so I'm sticking with it and if I have any other opinions, I'll update my review.<br />I think you'll like it too!",1
488,"I try to buy organic products whenever possible; so I decided to try this. I usually do not use milk quickly enough to justify buying a gallon of fresh milk; so this sounded good. I cannot find it in any of the stores in my area and Amazon is easy to deal with so this seemed like a good choice. Organic Valley should be a bit more forthcoming with specifics about this product; since many of us may not be familiar with it. I have used a lot of other nonfat dry milk products, but this is quite different. Although the actual product description does not state that it is ""non-instant"", if you enlarge the picture, you can just barely read it on the front of the package. The mixing instructions on the package tell you that you can stir or shake to mix the milk, but your blender or an electric mixer are probably your best options. Stirring produces a very lumpy, undissolved mess. I called Organic Valley and spoke with a very complacent woman who informed me that she puts the dry milk and water in a jar and shakes it vigorously to mix it. She also informed me that since it is not an instant product, once it is mixed, you will need to stir or shake it again if it is not used immediately; because the mix will begin to settle. Once it is actually dissolved, the taste is wonderful: it tastes absolutely fresh.",1

490,"I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change. Before considering surgery, we decided to give some natural methods a try. After doing some research, we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazon.com. Since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before, which didn't work, we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results. Here is what we picked out.....<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOJ7S0"">Ainterol Pueraria Mirifica 500Pure Breast Capsules (100 caps)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D9AW"">Wild Yam Root 180 vcaps</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETA6W"">Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed 610 mg, Capsules 180ea</a><br />These are the ingredients that we sort of liked and decided to give them all a try. So I guess this review is for all three of them at the same time. She has been taking them for just over two months now and we both agree that we have seen a change. Her bust has grown by a little over two inches and her breasts definately fell and have more fullness to them. She is a lot more confident and says that her shirts sit on her much nicer. Now she has an extra excuse to spend a ton of money shopping for new clothes, but what can I say, I just love her. A little bit of caution, there are a couple of changes that happened after she started to take the combination of all three of those pills. Her natural body smell has changed a little, nothing negative of course or she would have stopped taking them, but it has altered just a little. And she sometimes complains that her boobs are a little sore. But there has been a significant size difference and I believe that this stuff works. Good luck to you ladies and guys remember to love your women, they're just as sensitive about their boobs as we are about our penises!",0
491,"Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.<br /><br />Simply put it clumps.<br /><br />The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement.",1
492,"Just like the reviewer above me I placed an order for these 3 weeks ago only to be sent a cancellation email telling me that amazon could not get them in stock even though they had them in stock last night. I have been disregarded by CS reps on multiple occasions and told that amazon would not have them back in stock (even though they had them minutes before for a much higher price). It would seem that instead of standing behind their sales, they find it easier to cancel the orders of their customers and tell them to re-order for a much higher price after already waiting 3 weeks for the product that was purchased. Seriously disappointed in amazon, this is the third purchase in a row that has been cancelled due to them not wanting to/not able to fulfill the orders.",0
493,"As much as my family and I love cheese from Italy and Spain, we love French cheese more.  France is a country that produces more than 100 cheeses, so it must have been difficult to choose only four for this assortment, but in my opinion, four of the very best were chosen.<p>We are all watching our weight at my house, so we eat a lot of salads.  While cheese is definitely not a &quot;diet food,&quot; a little in a salad goes a long way, especially when you're using Buche Chevre.  My children love it on crackers as well.<p>My wife and I reserved the chaource and the epoisses for a &quot;wine and cheese&quot; party, but believe me, they are so wonderful and so special, you'll be tempted to eat them anytime, party or not.<p>The Gruy&egrave;re de Comt&eacute; is just so special I can't really find words to describe it.  It's rich.  It's creamy.  It's delectable.  We often eat it as a dessert cheese.  Yes, it's really that good!<p>If you're looking for a special gift, you can't go wrong with this French Cheese Assortment.  These are four of the finest cheese France has ever produced.",1

502,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0
503,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",0

505,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",0

507,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning.

I saw it in walmart I was going buy it for a lot different purposes but someone told me it been sitting on shelf meaning if store is closed at 12pm , they will not get new cocount oil replacing it or refridge it. It just sitting there all day , it was supposed to be refridged so you can eat. It is just like a milk that is supposed be in refridge! You see some stores having milk on shelf, it is likely to spoil faster than ones in refridge?<br /><br />I did a researching and I found out I was not supposed buy milk that store keep on shelf, it spoils faster no matter if I keep in freezer or refridge. It just drives temptaures crazy. If you buy milk from refridges , it will get used to temp. It is same with cocount oil (unrefined).<br /><br />It really doesn't matter if you buy organic or extra virgin ...organic is similar to extra virgin for real!

512,"If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way.

It was very fresh, had excellent aroma, and produced a very nice brew in my French press.  Upon receipt of the coffee I noticed that the bag was nowhere near full.  I have had other coffees come in less-than-full bags, but this one seemed to be way off. Since I sell merchandise online myself, I have an accurate postal scale.  The ""2 pound"" bag came in at almost 6 ounces less than a full 32, including the weight of the bag.  From previous orders from Amazon, other coffees seem to be based on the ""as delivered"" weight, not on some sort of weight prior to roasting.  The bag itself did not have a breather, so it is hard to imagine that almost 20% of the weight was lost in shipping. Don't know what happened here but the result is that I feel I payed almost 20% more for the beans than the advertised price.  I am curious if others have noticed this from this company.

535,"I was delighted when I found this item and ordered it to replace my treasured old Melitta 6-cup porcelain drip pot that had been dropped and broken.  The original pots were made in Germany and had a nicely sculptured shape.  Most important was their uniquely designed spout with its small hole that prevented coffee from dripping down the side of the pot when it was poured.  I don't know whether that spout design is patented and often wondered why its simplicity and effectiveness was never copied.<br /><br />The item that I received from Amazon was a very poor Chinese imitation of the original.  I would have returned it but it is not returnable (buyers beware!).  The shape of the pot is clumsy and thicker than the original.  The spout drips when liquid is poured from it.  Detailing of the filter is less refined and it may not work as well.  Even the box with its ersatz Melitta logo is too small for the pot, lending evidence to my assumption that this pot was made in a factory with poor quality control and under the direction of someone who doesn't understand why people valued the design in the first place.<br /><br />Melitta introduced the pot as an inexpensive item with the apparent marketing strategy of using it to sell its filters.  After they stopped producing it, the originals became collector's items.  The one we broke recently was purchased used by my German aunt from a thrift store in Germany to replace one we had lost in the 1994 Northridge earthquake.<br /><br />I would have been satisfied with a good imitation from Amazon, but the one I received was a waste of money.",1

541,"Full disclosure - I worked briefly for the people who make this product back in the late '70s.  Since I had a personal connection to the product, I really wanted to like it.  And it's not bad - it's OK, but it's just a bit odd.<br /><br />First off, the packaging.  These aren't your father's K-Cup, where it's an actual cup.  These have a top like the traditional cup (so they'll fit in the brewer) but the bottom is completely different.  It's almost more like a filter than a cup, and kinda rounded rather than cup-shaped.  They come in sealed plastic bags of twelve, so you need to keep them in a ziplock bag or some kind of airtight container once you open the bag, unless you're planning on using them all right away.<br /><br />Second, the flavor.  It's OK, not bad at all, but it just tastes a little off for some reason.  A hint of odd flavor.  Also, it seems to lack body, for want of a better term.  It doesn't have that rich, full, satisfying flavor I expect from a good cup of French Roast.<br /><br />Lastly, it seems to leave more sediment in the bottom of the cup than traditional K-Cups - not sure if that's a by-product of the design or what.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's not like I'm going to throw them away.  I'll keep them and drink them, but I probably won't buy them again.  I much prefer the flavor of just about any regular K-Cup to these, even non-premium brands like Folger's.<br /><br />UPDATE: After drinking my way through the whole case and comparing them with other K-Cup products, I have a bit more appreciation for these and might consider buying them again, particularly given the excellent price of around 38 cents a cup if you use Subscribe and Save.  One other point I neglected to mention in my original review is that these seem to produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam that appears on top of a good cup of coffee - than most K-Cup products.  Keep an eye out for my reviews of the Rainforest Blend (which I found somewhat weak and flavorless) and Fog Chaser (which just arrived and I've yet to sample) varieties coming soon.",1

Within the last two weeks, I've started allowing them to be uncrated in my house without me there.  Previously, they were completely untrustworthy, but I feel really guilty crating them while I'm at work.  And I thought they were acting more grown up.  Not chewing my stuff, just theirs.

The recalled products include Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, and Venison and Green Pea dry cat food. Recent laboratory results show that the products contain melamine. We believe the source of the melamine is a rice protein concentrate. Natural Balance has confirmed this morning that some production batches of these products may contain melamine.<br /><br />The recall was prompted by consumer complaints received by Natural Balance involving a small number of cats and dogs that developed kidney failure after eating the affected product.<br /><br />Dogs or cats who have consumed the suspect food and show signs of kidney failure (such as loss of appetite, lethargy and vomiting) should be seen by a veterinarian. We recommend our customers immediately stop feeding our recalled venison products regardless of date code and return unused product to their retailer for a full refund.<br /><br />The products are packaged in bags, cans and zip lock treat bags and sold in pet specialty stores and PetCo nationally.<br />No other Natural Balance products are involved in this voluntary recall as none of our other formulas include the rice protein concentrate.<br /><br />Although the problems seem to be focused on a particular production period of the venison products, over the last four days we have notified our distributors and retailers by phone and e-mail to immediately stop selling and return all recalled Venison dog foods and treats and the Venison dry cat food. Venison canned cat food is not involved.<br /><br />The source of the melamine appears to be a rice protein concentrate, which was recently added to the dry venison formulas. Natural Balance does not use wheat gluten, which was associated with the previous melamine contamination.<br /><br />We continue to work closely with the FDA in their ongoing investigation.<br /><br />Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-829-4493 or email [...]<br /><br />another one:<br /><br />Breaking Voluntary Recall News: Thursday, April 26th, 2007<br /><br />Our canned food manufacturer, American Nutrition, from Ogden Utah, just informed us that they are recalling all canned products made in their plant that contain rice protein concentrate. American Nutrition continued by telling us that they added this ingredient to four of our canned products without our knowledge or consent. The four products involved are:<br /><br />Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz<br />Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food 3 oz & 6 oz<br /><br />There have been no illnesses reported related to feeding these formulas, however, to comply with the American Nutrition recall of the four products, we are pulling all dates and batches of these four formulas. We also ask that our customers return unused product for a full credit to their store.<br /><br />To make sure that this does not happen in the future, we are demanding from each of our co-manufacturers daily production record of all of our formulas before they are shipped to us and written certification of NO rice protein or any deviation of our formulas. We have reviewed all of our other products and determined that they are free of rice protein concentrate and that all of our other product labels are accurate.",0

Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods.

564,"I prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that Meyerberg sells. The condensed has a more sour flavor to it.  One has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes ""different"". When it is warm, it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. Cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor.<br /><br />I actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. It is like ice milk as this is milk, but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet.<br /><br />The recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill)<br /><br />1 cup white sugar<br /><br />1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana)<br /><br />1/8 tsp salt<br /><br />My electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes.<br /><br />I like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. I can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks, so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. Granted one is used to cow's milk, but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and I am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right.<br /><br />One can will make 3 quarts of milk.",1

566,"I truly searched for affordable monofloral raw honey.  White Gold is the least expensive one I've found, taking into consideration Amazon's free shipping for this product - barely over .51 瞽 per ounce.  I've already placed several orders for it, not only for myself but as gifts, because it's a real treat.  It's over 40% more expensive at my local Whole F**ds.<br /><br />White Gold, owned by Continental Systems, is real raw honey. I've talked with the company representative on more than one occasion.  First, they don't heat this honey whatsoever - it is cold packed.  It's raw.<br /><br />Wikipedia defines RAW HONEY as honey that is exists without adding heat above 120 簞F.  Wikipedia goes on to state: ""Local raw honey is sought after by allergy sufferers as the pollen impurities are thought to lessen the sensitivity to hay fever.""  White Gold is not heated at all.<br /><br />Monofloral honey is somewhat hard to find and always has a distinctive flavor since it comes from one plant species' nectar.  Monofloral clover honey is pale white, but a lot of polyfloral honeys are labeled as clover honey for the retail trade.  There are many different types of monofloral honeys so you can experiment and find out which is your favorite. Keep in mind that heat processing darkens (browns) honey.<br /><br />Further, White Gold is hand-packed and not whipped (aka, creamed).  That's significant because honey manufacturers often whip honey to make it more spreadable, but White Gold is already highly spreadable without this extra processing.<br /><br />White Gold is a logical beginning when you are trying to discover your favorite raw monofloral honey.  It has a unique fragrance that will probably be totally unfamiliar to you.  You'll probably like it very much right from the start and recognize the clover taste.<br /><br />In my opinion, the comparison of this raw pure clover honey to pasteurized standard table honey labeled clover is akin to comparing Grade A maple syrup to Grade B maple syrup.  And then in addition, one must consider that raw honey has health benefits that pasteurized honey completely lacks.",1

572,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand簧 Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.

Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",1

574,"What is wrong with me?  I ~love~ Product 19!  Not because it is healthy (for cold cereal), but because it tastes great and keeps its crunch.  How can Special K, which turns to mush on contact with milk, be so much more popular?  How can it be that even some ""fans"" in these reviews take shots at the taste of Product 19?  My love for this cereal may be slightly eccentric, but I do not rave about it from the perspective of especially favoring aggressively ""natural"" foods that are full of bran or whatever.  True, I hate Wonder Bread and other foods that have been processed beyond all recognition.  But I definitely do not favor twigs and berries.

575,"This drink shares a lot of its flavor profile with the aperitif Campari.  If you like Campari, you'll almost certainly like Chinotto.  As for the rest of you, read on!<br /><br />The first time I tried Campari, it was on a lark, because a character in Sarah Caudwell's novel Thus Was Adonis Murdered drank it frequently during a trip to Venice.  My first impression was that it was bitter, complex, and a bit overwhelming.  It wasn't awful, but I couldn't really bring myself to like it.  Eventually, I tried it again, and knowing this time what to expect I was better able to appreciate its multi-faceted complexity.<br /><br />I encourage you to practice the same perseverance with Chinotto, whose primary ingredient - a bittersweet citrus fruit - is also a major part of the Campari formula.  You will almost certainly NOT enjoy your first bottle.  Fear not...there are six of them, so take advantage of the opportunity to experiment with your palate.  Wait a few days and try again.<br /><br />You won't know until the second or third tasting whether you are a budding Chinotto aficionado or a detractor in the making.<br /><br />The reward, for those of you who take the time to discover a love of it, is a soda whose balanced taste makes it a far better companion to cuisine than the sickly sweet sodas we're accustomed to in America.  Chinotto marries excellently with the sorts of meals you'd normally have wine with...not something one could easily say of Coke or Pepsi.<br /><br />Ironically, American sodas (particularly the colas) often have complex and interesting formulas, but all that complexity is obscured by an excess of sugar (or sugar substitutes).  Chinotto has sweetness, but it's a balanced sweetness that lets the other ingredients shine through.  It's a drink that wakes up your whole tongue, which makes it excellent as an aperitif or a with-dinner drink.<br /><br />The only reason I give it four stars is that the spirit Campari, and the bottled pre-mixed CampariSoda cocktail (10% alcohol content, very difficult to find outside Italy) both have an extra splash of genius in the formula.  But for those times when you can't be drinking alcohol, Chinotto nearly reaches the same heavenly height.",1

579,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

581,"If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best. It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol. But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects. If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar. If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste. Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste. If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste. This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar. You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia. It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter. You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same.

584,"My father recently passed away from cancer.  It began as colon cancer, and he was almost dead from it when he finally went to the hospital.  It was stage three at that time.  He underwent emergency surgery at that time (almost three years ago), and was in ICU for almost a month.  We thought we were going to lose him right then and there.  He recovered but refused chemotherapy.  He also would not take the pre-mixed Flor Essence I got him after his recovery, although I didn't know that until I found it in his refrigerator back in December of 2009.  It was opened, and it appeared that he had sampled it, but that was all.  As the cancer progressed, it invaded his small intestine, his lungs, his liver, and completely involved his peritoneum.  When he was sent home from the hospital the last time, in April 2010, after surgical bypass for the tumor in his small intestine, he was placed on Hospice.  We knew there was very little chance of saving his life, but he was finally ready to try.  I put him on the Flor Essence, which I had bought locally.  As the weeks passed, the Hospice nurses and the alternative therapies doctor he began seeing were amazed that he was having so little pain.  In fact, he rarely needed a Percocet and only seemed to have pain in his left shoulder and arm (the natural therapies doctor said that was because of the location of the tumor pressing against his diaphragm which caused the shoulder on that side to ache).  About three weeks after his return from the hospital, I ordered a different Essiac tea from the Internet that said it had clinical trials proving its effectiveness, etc., etc.  My mother started him on the new tea and, as that week went on, his pain increased to the point that he was needing a Percocet every 2-3 hours.  Knowing the only thing we had changed was the tea, I immediately started him back on the Flor Essence.  The very first day, he became slightly nauseous again (a side effect he had from the beginning with Flor Essence, the natural therapies doctor said this was because it was killing cancer cells), and his pain decreased to the point that, once again, he only needed a Percocet occasionally.  The difference was so dramatic it was almost unbelievable.  Unfortunately, our measures were too little, too late, to save his life, but when he passed away (exactly six weeks after being sent home from the hospital), he was having no pain and had not had a Percocet in 36 hours.<br /><br />Please, if you have cancer, don't refuse to fight, as my father did. Fight it with everything you have.  His worry was how much it would cost his family monetarily.  We tried to convince him that we loved him more than the money it cost, but he couldn't let us pay for his treatment.  It just wasn't in him to allow it.  But, whatever treatment you try, be it surgery, chemo, radiation, or natural treatments, add Flor Essence to your regimen from the beginning.  Although the Flor Essence I ordered on Amazon did not arrive prior to my father's passing, I kept the packages of tea I had ordered and gave them to my family members.  Everyone can benefit from the cleansing power of Flor Essence and, after seeing what it did for my father's pain, I would recommend it to anyone fighting a painful disease.  And, please, don't trust in the effectiveness of other Essiac tea products.  I learned the hard way and will always regret that I caused my father pain he need not have had in his final days.  Flor Essence is the Real Deal.<br /><br />One final note.  If you have cancer, or any other painful disease, may God Bless You, and may you find this review to be helpful to you.",1

600,"This is amazing.  I like it better than all other coconut oils.  Of course it tastes like coconut.  I don't want to use oils that are so overly processed and refined that they taste like ""nothing"".  I don't understand why the coconut flavor bothers some people.  If you don't like coconut, find a different oil.<br /><br />You can use this for grilling, frying, baking, sauteeing, greasing & flouring a cake pan, and all other places that you'd use butter or a Crisco-type product.  Just be careful on the baking because this melts at a low temperature.<br /><br />It is amazing as a skin softener, a hair conditioner, a leave in hot oil treatment, make-up remover, eyelash conditioner/glosser, shaving ""cream"", lip softener, cuticle oil, nail conditioner, bath oil, after bath oil, massage oil (add a few drops of essential oil if you wish), etc.  Speaking of massage oil, this is an excellent product for ""adult activities"" . . . as a perk it is definitely edible.<br /><br />If you have dry feet, slather this on, rub it in, wrap your feet with plastic wrap, cover with socks, and go to bed.  In the morning your feet will feel nice and soft.<br /><br />This can be used on leather such as shoes, jackets, and purses.  Because it's clear, you can use it on leather products that have decorative stitching that you can't cover with regular colored polish.  (In fact, I just bent over and put coconut oil on my black leather shoes with my fingers . . . the only clean up needed was to rub my hands together.)<br /><br />I've even used it on my wood furniture to obtain the same results as furniture oils.  I have used it to grease hinges and mechanical parts.  I have heard that you can use it to add lustre to pearls but I'm too chicken to try it on my good stuff.<br /><br />I know people that have used it as a laxative (in large quantities) and a diet aid.  When I eat about a T. a day my skin is softer and my wrinkles are less noticable.<br /><br />I keep finding new uses.  I'm sure you'll find some, too.",1
601,"Sorry folks, I bought this out of curiosity.  It's exactly what you think it is -- REALLY FAKE TASTE!  It ruins your potato soup with a fake bacon taste that leaves a bad aftertaste.  I was not impressed.  The worst part is that there are 4 bottles that I now have no purpose for.  Guess what the in-laws are getting for Christmas???  :o) I LOVE bacon, as does my husband and neither of us liked it.  It's loaded with MSG, so be careful.  If you want to add a bacon flavor to something, ADD BACON, there is no substitute.  If you are vegan or vegetarian - you shouldn't WANT the taste of bacon on anything, so get over it.  I really do not recommend this product.  If you REALLY want to try it, I have four barely used bottles I'll send you for the shipping cost.  I want them out of my house!",0
602,"I actually had bad effects using this tea.  I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi).  Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on.  Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it).  I also felt like fainting at a few points.  The effects did go away within about 5 hours.  This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.<br /><br />These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill.  So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea.  Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you.  Take care if you do try it, and good luck!",0
603,"This tea taste is good.Sometimes I add agave to it however not a neccessity.I drink it cold and hot.I find that I really don't want my coffee if I drink it in the morning.I am not sure if it is doing what Dr.Oz said it was good for which was to eat fat cells, I do know that I feel pretty good after drinking it. Good tea, especially if you are wanting off the fifty cup coffee thing a day. Also the seller sent a box of white tea with it, I guess some type of sell, I did not pay extra for it,but they sure have gain themselves a customer with their white tea also, which i believe is suppose to block fat cell(can't remember for sure).It taste good though.",1
604,"TV commercials like the vendor uses make me skittish. I wouldn't have gone near this with a ten foot pole had I not been behind a woman in scrubs purchasing some in a convenience store. I asked her if it worked, she was very favorable and her doctor/boss was positive about it as well. I went home, did more research, saw that the results ran the gamut, but I saw no one experiencing any severe side effects. I took the plunge.<br /><br />I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) that is under control with medication, but I'd been recently finding myself extremely tired from early afternoon to the end of my work day (and beyond). I started out with half a bottle of 5-hour after lunch and am extremely happy with the result. It's not dramatic - it just gets me from ""tired"" to ""not tired"" for the afternoon and early evening. I've experienced none of the side effects that others have, but two things that I'm doing are (1) not drinking on an empty stomach, and (2) only using 1/2 bottle.<br /><br />I'm by no means downplaying anyone else's experiences - we're all different, our bodies react differently to all sorts of things, but I would definitely recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Above all - listen to your body.",1

I ordered<br />some of this from amazon(great service btw) and i was a little concerned when i opened it because it looked almost like peanut butter. I called the company directly in California. They put the plant manager on the phone to answer my questions. I asked him why it was a different color than i was used to.(most almond butters are sort of grayish). He told me that they don't grind the skins with the almonds. Also the top grade of palm fruit oil that they use is high in cartenoids and helps to keep this product stable (not rancid) and adds to the color. Also they process this product to keep it as natural and roasted flavor filled as possible. I was impressed with the manager, the product and the company.

612,"I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br /><br />This Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Amazon. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best.

I took -- and still take, 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day. If I am not able to pump, I add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more, to keep my milk supply going strong. This is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished, if stress, schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way! Five stars for fenugreek (and blessed thistle, too!) As a side note, the lactation nurses have told me, that these herbs do lower your blood sugar, so they should be taken with food.

It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican.

620,"Have you ever been to a nice Italian restaurant that grated real cheese right onto your dish?  Remember the wonderful aroma, taste, and texture?  Well you can buy that same cheese and enjoy a fantastic culinary experience every time you serve pasta, salad, or many other dishes.  This is not it.  Ever since discovering REAL Parmesan cheese, I will never buy this product again.<br /><br />This powder-like substance is nothing like the real thing.  It has a poor aroma, flat processed taste, and doesn't even look like real cheese.  I'm not sure why it tastes so bad.  I suspect the cheese itself isn't of the quality of real imported Parmigiano to begin with, plus it's been pre-grated with added chemicals.  Sure, it adds a little flavor and adds a little light coloring to the dish, but do yourself a big favor and skip this.<br /><br />Look for real Parmigiano Reggiano (I found it at my local warehouse club), or Parmigiano Reggiano Stravecchio which is aged a little more and is fantastic.  Also get a decent grater (amazon has the nice Zyliss 11370 that works great for Parmesan).  Yes it will cost about 2-3x per pound what the Kraft costs, but it is easily 100x as good.  Less will go a lot further, so you really won't spend much more for a vastly better product.  Just grating the real thing fills the room with a beautiful, addictive aroma!<br /><br />Alternately, you can get a great ""real"" Romano cheese block also which is about the same price as this per pound and is also excellent grated onto pasta dishes, or even mixed with the Parmigiano for added zing.<br /><br />I use both regularly.  Recently I used the Kraft stuff someone else brought to a potluck, and while it may be better than nothing, it reminded me how low American taste buds have gotten if this is the most popular grated cheese on the market.  I am reminded of when I served guests REAL maple syrup, but they didn't like it because it didn't taste like the fake stuff they were used to - artificially flavored corn syrup.  For someone like that, or who prefers cool-aid to juice, hot dogs over sirloin, etc., then like the cave dwellers in Plato's Republic, perhaps they simply cannot accept something different.  But I would hope most people do want something better!<br /><br />To be fair, this will keep for a year on your shelf (unlike the real thing), so if you want it for emergency use or you are headed to Antarctica for 6 months, you might actually have a use for this powdery stuff.  If so, though, keep in mind that despite saying 100% real, this Kraft product does have added ingredients including cellulose powder and potassium sorbate (a preservative).  Other bottled brands, such as Bakers & Chefs (which I think tastes a little better than Kraft) don't have added preservatives.  Amazon also carries Racconto brand which I haven't tried.",0
621,"We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as ""extra bold"" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you.

The 3rd pot of tea is as good as the first, the 4th is weak.<br /><br />The tea itself is excellent. Some of the best I've tasted and I'm very particular about the tea I drink. I've been enjoying the variety that came with the pot - haven't found one I've disliked yet and it is fun trying them all.<br /><br />Since you will get about 6 cups of tea with each tea flower - they are all beautiful, I put the teapot on the table while the tea steeps so every can enjoy it. You will want to drink this with family or friends.<br /><br />The whole set comes packaged nicely in a bamboo box that looks handmade. The box is pretty enough to be re-used for something else.

The pictures and description do say packets, so hopefully the name will not be misleading for purchasers. I received one of these packages in the sampler pack of K-Cups that came with my Keurig. It was strange to have a packet of cocoa mix in there with all the K-Cups but I thought maybe there was something in particular that made them special for the Keurig. Nope.<br /><br />You just put the powder from the package into your mug and run hot water through your Keurig and stir it up. Basically, you use your Keurig just to heat up the water. The hot cocoa tastes good and everything, but there is nothing that makes it specially made for the Keurig (except the marketing line that says it is).<br /><br />They have some line about it being the right ""portion"" size somewhere on the box, but there is nothing special about that either.

No matter how we prepare them I can still taste the weirdness and would rather have the calories from real pasta.

I think the other reviewers just see the nylon bag and think, wow, this must be good tea.<br /><br />One other gripe, they make the strings to short on the bags.  They aren't long enough for the tab to hang over the edge of a normal sized coffee cup.

635,"My first-time pregnant wife saw this tea and thought that it couldn't hurt, even if she doubted the efficacy of its claims. She offered me a sip of the tea, and I must say that I liked the combination of mint, fruit, lemon, and spicy flavors. I bought some more tea, and together my wife and I would each enjoy a cup in the evening while sitting out on our back porch and watching the sun set.<br /><br />About a month after drinking this delicious tea, I woke up one morning feeling very queasy. When I told my wife why I looked green in the face, she smiled at me with great compassion and love. ""You're having sympathy symptoms."" I looked at her blankly. She continued, ""It's called Couvade syndrome, from the French `couver', meaning `to hatch'. It's when men feel and experience the physical symptoms associated with pregnancy."" ""Oh,"" I said, ""I wonder how far it goes."" My wife looked at me with loving eyes, laughed, and gave me a hug. ""I love you,"" she said.<br /><br />A few weeks later I found out just how far Couvade syndrome can go when I gained twenty pounds; began suffering backaches, stomachaches, cramping, and mild incontinence; and started craving some foods while finding others nauseating. My wife found my symptoms amusing and endearing, and in that spirit I took a home-pregnancy test, for fun. When the results came back positive, I became concerned. My wife thought I was playing a joke on her, but when then next two tests also came out positive, she also became worried. On our next visit to her OB/GYN, we asked her doctor about my positive results. She looked at me with some concern and told us that elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG--the hormone tested for in at-home pregnancy tests) levels in men are sometimes indicative of testicular cancer. I think I fainted, because I next remember waking up on an exam bed. The doctor recommended an oncologist to me and I set up an appointment right away.<br /><br />The oncologist explained how hCG may be produced by germ cell tumors and had some of my blood drawn for tests. That night was the most terrifying of my life as I waited for the lab results. When I saw the doctor the next day, she gave me the happiest news of my life: besides the hCG, all the other tests were negative for the most common testicular cancers. She still wanted a biopsy to be safe, and I consented, even though the idea of extracting it was not pleasing, to say the least. The biopsy results also came back clean, but the oncologist recommended that I come back in a month to monitor any changes. In the meantime, my wife and I went back to her OB/GYN for an ultrasound, and just for fun, I asked if I could have one too. The doctor humored me and scanned my lower abdomen. When she saw the screen, however, she nearly dropped the probe. ""What is it?"" I asked. ""It looks like you have a uterus,"" she said, ""with a fetus inside of it."" I think I fainted. When I woke up, my wife and her doctor were both looking down at me with concern. ""Is he always like this?"" the doctor asked. ""Yes,"" answered my wife, ""but it's been especially bad since the pregnancy."" ""Whose?"" the doctor asked. Everybody laughed. I asked her how this could have happened, and she mentioned intersexualism and chimerism, but I assured her that I was as male as male can be. Nonetheless, she suggested genetic testing.<br /><br />I began to think very hard about when my pregnancy symptoms began, and I realized they all started with the tea. I immediately stopped drinking it, and I began to notice my symptoms slowly disappearing. I had the genetic testing done and all my cells were typically XY male, with no abnormalities. The second ultrasound showed only the appropriate abdominal organs for a male, with no trace of a uterus or fetus. In fact, the only evidence that I had ever been pregnant is a grainy photo from the first ultrasound. The medical community has dismissed my case as mass hysteria, or ""folie &agrave; deux"". They may be at a loss to explain what happened, but I know the truth.",0
636,Wow.  Taken by surprise that the shipping costs more than the product.  Too late to cancel but never again....,0
637,"I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.",1

642,"Some in my family are allergic to various artificial food colors, but my kids really didn't want a white birthday cake cause it is boring.  Beet powder is the perfect coloring for us.  I simply mix it with a small amount of hot water, let it sit a minute, then strain through cheesecloth.  I then use the liquid in making my frosting and it is a beautiful bright pink color--prettier than standard food coloring IMO, and a perfect color for little girls' birthdays.  I have also just added the powder directly to the frosting, which works but it takes a while for the color to appear full strenth and if you look closly you will see tiny dots of beet powder.<br /><br />I also use beet powder to make colored sugar, pouring a tiny amount of liquid on sugar, mixing well, letting it dry, and breaking up any clumps.  I then use that sugar to make homemade peeps that the whole family can eat (recipe at http://www.marthastewart.com/article/homemade-easter-treats).  Mine don't look nearly as good as Martha's, but they tase wonderful.<br /><br />I have even used beet powder to make candy canes (recipe at http://candy.about.com/od/hardcandyrecipes/r/candy_canes.htm).  Instead of adding food coloring, just add some beet liquid AFTER taking the candy off the heat and cooling slightly. I have also used it in other hard candies, the only problem is that if the candy hardens before you have shaped it  you can't reheat it on the stove or the beet stuff will burn, turn brown, and taste nasty.  That only happens at very high temperatures, however. You can add beet powder to baked goods without burning it.<br /><br />This stuff goes a long way as a food coloring.  One small package has lasted us a year and a half, using it a couple of times a month, and I am just now nearly done with it.  No one has ever noticed a beet flavor in the finished products because you only need a tiny amount.",1

645,"Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called ""Cashew Cookie"", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was ""Where's the coconut?!"" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.",1

649,"On Sri Lanka - which means ""Resplendent Island"" in Sanskrit - tea has been cultivated since the second half of the 19th century. After in 1869 most of the island's coffee plantations were devastated by a fungus that left the few (at the time, only experimentally planted) tea bushes untouched, a Scotsman named James Taylor, who had acquired some basic knowledge on tea plantation in Northern India, was put in charge of production. Under his shrewd management, output rose from a mere 23 lbs. to 81.3 tons between 1873 and 1880, and further to 22,899.8 tons by 1890.<br /><br />Most of Sri Lanka's tea plantations are situated at elevations between 3,000 and 8,000 feet in the island's southwestern part, to the east of Colombo and in the south. Although the island changed its official name from the colonial Ceylon (from Selan Dwipa, which possibly means ""Island of Gems"") to Sri Lanka in 1972, many companies continue to use the old name for its tea.<br /><br />Taylors' single-estate Ceylon tea comes from one of Sri Lanka's oldest and most distinguished tea growing areas, the Dimbula region on the western slopes of the southern/central mountain range; with plantations from approximately 3,500 to 5,000 feet above sea level. It is representative of the lighter teas for which this area is particularly well-known.

I rated this product 1 star because like other reviewers, I too received a 50-ct box of nearly expired product.  When you buy this stuff in the store it has roughly a one year shelf life.  The box I was sent expires in two months.  A box of 50 is like a one year supply for me.

It made a delicious, if slightly too-sweet Aviation cocktail. Now that Eric Seed (of Haus Alpenz) has gotten real classic liqueurs back into stores, I prefer the more authentic ingredients. That doesn't mean the Monin Violet has lost favor in my kitchen -- when I make a Violette fizz, I often substitute Monin for plain simple syrup for extra violet kick.<br /><br />This syrup makes wonderful soda and lemonade. It really pleased my teetotaler guests.<br /><br />If you're shopping for violet flavoring for baking, candy-making or flavoring ice cream, you should search for extract or concentrate.

666,"This is a good matcha for the price. The best matcha can be much more expensive but well worth it, espcially if you happen to study the Japanese tea ceremony or you are a tea connoseur. If you do get this type of tea, it is wise to buy a proper bamboo wisk and sift it first, otherwise it can get lumpy. Making matcha the traditional way is well worth the effort and there is a LOT to learn about it. Some say to master the tea ceremony can take years.<br /><br />As far as the health benefits go, there is a lot of talk about green tea being good for you and I must say, I feel really good now that I am drinking it 1-3 days per week and I have even lost a few pounds. Matcha does have caffine and if I have more than two or three bowls I will definately feel it. It's probably a wise idea to not drink too much matcha before bed! Green and black tea both have caffine for the most part. Different teas have different amounts of caffine. It's a good idea to read labels carefully and do your research if you are sensitive to caffine or must avoid it. The type of caffine in a beverage also has a lot to do with how people respond to it. Caffine also has a different effect on everyone depending on your body. Some people get jittery, others don't and the more caffine you consume the less you will tend to feel the effects of it. I tend to feel jittery with coffee or soda but not with tea.<br /><br />Matcha is also great for smoothies, baking, ice cream and much, much more. Another note; Fresh matcha is a very bright green color, old matcha gets a darker pine-gray color to it and can taste bitter or ashy with a clumpy consistancy. Always note the date on the can. To avoid stale green tea, I reccommend storing it in an airtight bag and keeping it in the fridge. Stale tea isn't noticable when you put it in a smoothie or cake but if you make a hot beverage you will notice a big difference in the quality.<br /><br />Matcha is generally served with sweets and is good paired with fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends to clash with chocolate. Of course mochi (sweet rice cakes) go very well with matcha and are the traditional choice but unless you live near an Asian market, or you're a good cook, they can be hard to come by and have a short shelf life. The frozen Mochi ice cream nuggets are a good option too and sold in a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />I reccommend this tea if you are new to drinking matcha. If you love it, it's the tastiest matcha in it's price range and if you hate it, at least you didn't waste too much cash. If you are taking tea lessons it's a good 'practice' tea and won't break your pocketbook, especially when you find out the price of tea bowls, fukusa, natsume, furo and the other utensils used in a tea ceremony!<br /><br />Regardless if you study Chado or if you are a casual tea drinker, I encourage all tea lovers to try matcha. The methods of making and preparing matcha are over 800 years old and when you taste it, you certainly understand why it's never gone out of style!",1

670,"Back when I used the breeze cat system, there were 4 cats in the apartment (2 are my cats, and the other 2 were my brother's cats that I was temporarily taking care for him).  I had the breeze next to the original litter box for 3 days and none of the cats used it.  They all went on top of the pellets to check it out but did not pee/poop in there.  One of the cats tried to eat a pellet and I took it away from him.  I *think* none of them actually ate it.<br /><br />On the 4th day, I took the original litter box away, and then they all started using the breeze.  There were no ""accidents"" in the apartment and I did not find pee or poop on the floor or carpet.  I think the fact that I placed some of the pellets with their original litter really helped them get accustomed to the product (and also since the breeze system was sitting there for 3 days, they were at least familiarized with it).<br /><br />The pad that sucked up the pee worked really well.  I experimented to figure out the right time to change the pad for the 4 cats.  It turned out to be every 3 days.  As for hard poop, I was ok with it staying at the top of the system and would pick it up with a plastic bag and throw it out (very easy).<br /><br />The problem is with the runny/watery poop which will go all over the pellets and is tougher and takes longer to clean.  A lot of the pellets ended up getting thrown out once the watery poop touched them.  Also, this system does not do anything to help minimize the poop smell, which is the main complaint for my boyfriend regarding this system.  In the end, we did not keep the breeze because the smell was too horrible.  Even if you clean it up immediately after the cat pooped, the smell was still there.<br /><br />We went back to the original litter box.  I am going to keep my eye on this product to see if tidy cats come out with better pellets that will do something about poop smell.

674,"First, I am quite surprised at how expensive this product is on Amazon; my local health food store (with a notoriously high mark-up on products) sells it for about 3.59/box. Otherwise it is a good product; definitely more potent than store-bought yogurt as a starter, but I've actually had much better results using my probiotic capsules that I use as a dietary supplement. Here's a quick comparison of results with yogurt starters:<br /><br />Store-bought yogurt: incubates in about 8 hours, results in runny yogurt<br />Yogourmet: incubates in about 5-6 hours, results in relatively thin yogurt<br />2 probiotic capsules: incubates in 3 hours, results in thick, luscious yogurt",1

Real beef jerky makes my jaw ache, and I end up spitting out gristle too frequently.  But this?  This is perfect.  If ""they"" replaced meat with this Soylent Brown-type food, I'd happily leave the Real Thing behind.  I'm not sure of the health benefits.  I guess it's good for me.

I've tried 3 different organic matchas in the past and this is, by far, the best.<br /><br />This is a vibrant green color (very pretty color - especially when made)This is proof that young leaves were chosen and dried properly.  The brighter, the better.  Some matchas are dull green (dirty pea green color) - these are more of a food grade matcha (for baking, ice creams, etc.).  Food grade matchas have a dull taste as well. Ceremonial (drinking) tea should always be vibrant.  This is an excellent drinking tea.<br /><br />The packaging is the best I've seen.  Not only does it come in a sealed pop/top can, but once opened you will find your tea inside a sealed foiled bag. Impressive.

691,"I usually do not write reviews on Amazon (or anywhere else for that matter), but I really have to make an exception in this case because of how well this device works.  It is rare for any device to work exactly as expected, but the Victor Blackbox Gopher Trap works above and beyond any expectations that I had for it.  I do not work for the Victor company, and I have no financial stake in the sales of their products.  I am simply an exasperated homeowner who got fed up wih gophers tearing up his property and decided to give this device a try.<br /><br />I had used poison pellets, smoke bombs, water hose, and those silly sonic devices... nothing worked and those gophers were probably laughing at me.  With the Blackbox, it's nearly a sure thing.  Also, you actually get to see the results with a dead gopher right in front of you, unlike smoke bombs and poison which are always a guessing game as to whether or not they actually did their job.<br /><br />Within 2 day of getting this product, I had already caught 3 gophers.  One of those gophers was caught less than 1 hour after I set the trap.  Free lunch on my property is now officially over.<br /><br />The key to the effectiveness of this trap is to find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br /><br />My sure kill method:<br /><br />1) Find a freshly dug up gopher mound.<br />2) Dig out the mound until you find the tunnel.<br />3) Place the activated trap flush with the entrance of the tunnel, with the small round hole (on one side of the trap) facing outward.<br />4) Cover up the gaps at the top, sides and bottom of the trap with dirt so that it looks like the tunnel extends into the Blackbox, but make sure the opening to the trap is unobstructed from inside their tunnel.<br /><br />The idea is to make the trap seem like an extension of the gopher's tunnel, and by instinct the gopher will head towards that small open hole on the other side of the trap to plug it up (they don't like any openings into their tunnels).  Once he enters the trap, it's goodnight Gracie.  This trap is so strong that the gopher will be nearly snapped in half.<br /><br />Before getting the Blackbox, I had also tried using a ""Macabee"" gopher trap (the one with the 2 pincers that snap together) but the gopher simply pushed that trap out of his tunnel.  The Macabee is also a lot more risky to use and harder to set (in terms of triggering it accidentally on your hand).  The Blackbox is safer to use and much easier to set because the trigger mechanism and the killing device is contained fully within the box itself.  The Macabee trap can also be dragged away by a dying gopher if it is not properly secured.  There is definitely no chance of a gopher dragging away a Blackbox.<br /><br />In summary, I wish I had used the Blackbox from the beginning.  It would have saved me a lot of time, money, frustration and parts of my yard.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug-17-2011:  I have just posted some pics as proof of the effectiveness of this device.  After 13 captures within the first 4 months of use, I have not seen any more gopher activity since April 2011. I guess word got out in the gopher community that there is now a steep price of admission onto this property.",1

Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.

Secondly, the sugar content could perhaps be toned down a bit to trim back some calories because it's very sweet. One serving is counted as 3/4 cup, compared to 1 cup for many other cereals.

711,"see update at end of review<br /><br />******************<br /><br />I was lamenting about only having frech lettuce, herbs, chives, and tomatoes from may garden during the long fall-winter-spring parts of the year. The refrigerated stuff from the grocery store goes bad right away and does not taste as good as the fresh stuff from the garden, either.<br /><br />Then I saw a Time Magazine page on the new AeroGrow AeroGarden, and I just had to try it out. After reading the AeroGrow website before making the purchase, I realized that buying one garden would not work for me, as the tomatoes cannot be grown in the same garden as lettuce & herbs. This is partially due to the large amount of room taken up by the tomatoes, and also because the lamp/watering cycle is different and finally because the nutrients are different.<br /><br />So, I bought two gardens, along with the Salad Greens seed kit and Cherry Tomato seed kit. Each garden comes with a mixed herb kit, so I figured to mix in a few herbs with the other seeds, and if they did not work, no big loss.<br /><br />The products came quickly and the instructions for assembly were very clear and well written with excellent diagrams. I came to realize that this somewhat pricey product at least comes from a company that produces a classy product (a rare thing these days). I found a space on a shelf beside the basement stairs, and placed both assembled gardens there. I also bought and placed a digital thermometer with maximum/minimum temperature memory readouts ($10 at Radio Shack), because I was unsure of what temperature extremes the plants might experience in that location (68-72 as it turns out).<br /><br />The seed kits contain pre-seeded planting pods. Each pod is basically a plastic cup shaped frame with two pieces of foam rubber inside the cup part, like two slices of bread with the seeds sandwiched between them. They simply insert into the seven holes in the top of the garden's water tank. The Salad Greens and Herbs come with seven pods per kit, while the Tomatos come with three pods plus four hole plugs-the plants are bigger so three of them take up thw whole space available. The hole plugs prevent evaporation of the water through the unoccupied holes.<br /><br />The water tank holds exactly one gallon of regular drinking water. Well water is not recommended, presumably because of impurities, and since I am on a well I bought two one-gallon plastic jugs of 'drinking water' at the store for 50 cents each and filled the tanks with their contents. A pump in the tank takes water and pipes it to the rim of each of the seven holes in the tank's top, and here the trickle of water flows into the foam sandwich of each seed pod. The foam stays moist and the rest of the water drips back down into the tank. The garden's 'computer' cycles the water flow on and off according to the amount recommended for the type of plant being grown. A water level sensor turns on a flashing red light when it is time to add more water to the tank.<br /><br />The top of the garden is a reflector with two compact-fluorescent lamps, of the variety that has the special ultraviolet (UV) coating that causes the emmitted light to resemble sunlight. The reflector rides on a vertical pole that extends up from the garden's base, so you can raise and lower the lamps as required to keep them the correct distance above the plants. The garden's 'computer' also turns the lamps on and off according to a schedule tailored to the type of plant. If using the gardens in a place where the light might be a problem at night, you can syncronize the computer so that the lights are on only during the daytime and off when you are trying to sleep.<br /><br />The seed kits come with little clear plastic cups that cover each pod until the seeds have germinated, then you can dispose of them. The kits also come with a bag of nutrient tablets, which you add to the water tank when the computer prompts you to by flashing a red light. The nutrients are tailored to the type of plant being grown, and there are enough of them to feed the plants during their anticipated life span.<br /><br />I planted one garden with five salad green (leaf lettuce) pods, plus one pod each from the Herb kit, chives and parsley. The other garden got the threee pods from the Cherry Tomato kit; two reds and one yellow variety.<br /><br />Each seed pod has a label that tells you how many days to wait for plants to appear after germination. All of my plants appeared like clockwork.<br /><br />I have had the gardens for about six weeks now, and have been enjoying salads containing lettuce, parsley and chives plus other odds and ends from the fridge, for the last two or three weeks. The lettuce and herbs are all beautiful, with no problems from bugs or too much/too little water, excessive temperatures, etc. No need to wash the plants or check for bugs or pick off bad spots, everything goes straight to the salad bowl. What a joy! Even with only five lettuce plants, I have to eat two meals including salad each day to keep up with the growth. This would easily feed two people, and if all seven salad green pods had been used, three people.<br /><br />The tomatoes are all doing well ahnd have been pruned according to instructions. It will be some time yet before they produce flowers, and then fruit. But based on the health of the plants, I expect a good yield.<br /><br />Each seed kit comes with a full color manual/booklet that covers all aspects of 'planting', germinating, feeding, pruning (if required) and then harvesting the plants. There are also photos of plants where things have gone wrong (leaves burned because the lamps were not raised up as the plants grew taller, etc) with clear instructions on how to recognize problems and correct them. Harvesting instructions clearly tell how much can be taken at a time without killing the plant, and so on.<br /><br />The AeroGrow gardens are a well designed, well built product with excellent documentation. All my visitors are amazed at how well the product works, and many have gone out and bought their own. I anticipate years of improved eating because of this product.<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />Update November 2007<br /><br />I used my two gardens all Winter (2006/2007) until it was time to start getting produce from my real (outdoor) garden in the Summer, at which time I put the little gardens to rest for the season. During their use, I got a large crop of cherry tomatoes, all of which were beautiful. I went through on crop of lettuce and salad greens, and when the lettuce finally bolted, I replanted with only lettuce (no chives, etc this time) and got another couple of months worth of lettuce. I have now fired them up again in the Fall, and have nice little plants popping up. Aerogrow has more seed options available now, so I have planted a more interesting kind of lettuce.",1

718,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

723,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it.

724,"I have to admit I'm a bit of a seaweed snob.  I grew up eating seaweed so I'm not a stranger to it.  I've been on a health food kick lately and started to cook a lot of miso soups, legumes, etc.  Kombu is the quintessential ingredient for majority of the dishes I cook.  It lends that famous savoriness (umami) that only comes w/ Excellent quality harvested seaweed from Japan (see, I told you...snob) ;-p.<br /><br />When I first started back to cooking macrobiotic and raw food meals I purchased Kombu and Wakame from a lot of different vendors (coops, organic markets, asian groceries, online vendors, etc).  As I started cooking with all the different brands of seaweeds, I noticed there's a distinct difference in taste between the brands.  I have to say - Eden has one of the BEST seaweeds out there (texture, taste, no additives, clean).<br /><br />Everything I cook has that hearty savoriness with the Eden brand.  With other brands - the seaweed texture, color, and/or taste is subpar compared to Eden.  I don't know what it is but when I cook w/ the other seaweeds - seriously - it just tastes as if something is ""missing"".<br /><br />Since noticing the taste difference I wanted to know why Eden had one of the Best seaweeds...

So I was sure I'd find it for a better deal here...not the case.  The sale price is $29 for a case of 12.  That's $2.42 per can.

737,"Both of those sugars can be purchased cheap at any low carb online store (netrition has it for $7.50 for 1 lb!), and if I can purchase it that cheap, then you KNOW they're getting it dirt cheap.

I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally.  Yes, it's true, no one forced me to purchase them, but that's besides the point.  You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet.  EVERY producer of low carb sweets pull that stunt; however, you'll find all your ""non-sweet"" products, such as condiments, etc., moderately priced.  It's no coincidence.

738,"Although any mom would prefer to feed their baby breast milk, there are circumstances that do not allow everyone to do so. I am stuck in that boat. So, I went on a quest to find the next best thing, organic formula. My son has been on Earth's Best formula since he was one week old and has no problems at all.<br /><br />Here is what I LIKE about Earth's Best:<br /><br />ORGANIC.  I am very conscious about what I put in my own body so I wouldn't not have it any other way for my son. The use of pesticides and genetically modified ingredients is a terrifying concept to me. EB contains no growth hormones, antibiotics, steroids or potentially harmful pesticides or herbicides.<br /><br />EASY TO DIGEST. My son has no fussiness or issues with this formula. He's happy and content and has had no issues with gas or spitting up due to the formula. My son was a very colicky baby but we had tested out a few formulas before concluding that it was definitely not the EB causing his fussiness.<br /><br />AFFORDBILITY. Due to the recent recall of Similac organic formula, Earth's Best became the only affordable organic formula on the market that I could find readably available. The only other option available on the market besides Earth's Best is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJM9SU"">Babys Only Organic Toddler Formula, Dairy Iron Fortified, 12.7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> and at nearly $30 for 3 cans of 12.7 oz of formula was out of our means. With Amazon subscribe and save, this formula is nearly the same price as non-organic formula. How could I even consider feeding my son anything else?<br /><br />These are the ISSUES I have with the formula:<br /><br />SYRUP SOLIDS. Sugar in formula? Excuse me! This is really disappointing but I believe the organic element of the formula far outweighs switching to a non-organic formula. As I said earlier, Baby Only is too expensive to even be an option for us. Plus, I believe the use of pesticides in formula ingredients is a far more dangerous concept than sugar!<br /><br />DHA/ARA. I am not a fan of the synthetically derived DHA/ARA found in EB formula. However, there are no affordable formulas on the market that have naturally derived DHA/ARA. Therefore, its hard to judge EB alone. The formula industry should be required to find a NATURAL way to derive DHA/ARA if it should be allowed to market their product as organic.<br /><br />CLUMPS. The formula can be hard to mix properly without getting clumps. It takes an extra amount of patience and time to mix this formula. The best solution I have found is to mix the formula in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I481LM"">Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher</a>or use a handheld formula mixer such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K4Q9BG"">Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer</a> when making one bottle at a time. This way I do not get the bubbles that form from vigorous shaking.<br /><br />Although the EB formula is not perfect, it is the most affordable organic formula made on the market. However, if it is within your means, you may want to do a little bit of research on Baby Only formula.",1

I normally love STRONG coffee- but this is real garbage and it appears to have filler as well.).<br /><br />Avoid this junk, if you like dark strong coffee get Rainforest Hurricane Epresso instead or Dunkin Donuts original blend whole bean if you like a medium roast instead. This is terrible coffee made for a specific presentation, and that specific presentation is to cover up how horrible the coffee's quality and taste is. If you like the taste of burnt carob and a coffee that refuses to turn beige with milk.. this is your brand!!",0

746,"I have been using the Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for years.  I was in the process of ordering additional jars, when I read Ms Hill's comment, from December, 2008.  I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be ""hidden"", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides ""monosodium glutamate"" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, ""NO MSG ADDED"" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is ""processed into"" a product as opposed to being ""poured into"" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare ""NO MSG ADDED""  or ""NO ADDED MSG"", even though the product contains MSG.<br />Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG.",0

After doing some research on the web I found that the best way to brew the tea is as follows. Each plastic bag inside the box has 3/4 ounce of tea. This should make 3/4 gallon or 96 ounces. So all you need to do is bring to a boil half the amount or 48 ounces in a pot. Then let it sit off the burner for 2 minutes. Then add the pouch of loose leaf tea [3/4 ounce in total] and let it steep or brew for 7 minutes.... 10 minutes is too long and 5 minutes is too short. So set a timer it's important.<br />After 7 minutes strain the water through a strainer with a paper towel layed in it. *** Make sure the bowl is beneath the strainer ***. Then put the strained liquid into a pitcher and add the remaining 48 ounces of tap water. Refridgerate and in an hour so should be good to go.<br /><br />In each of these boxes there are 24 3/4 ounces packages which will make a total of 18 gallons of iced tea.,1

The impact on my health -- some increased stamina, altertness, and a very positive feeling of overall physical wellbeing -- has been quite remarkable.

The National Cancer Institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer. People who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk.""<br /><br />Stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - I mean you might as well just use sweet n' low. The only pure stevia brand I have found is SweetLeaf Stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste, but I have gotten used to it since I have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar. My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'.",0

772,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.

When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.

774,"A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations.  I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history.  The first two days, I only noticed a few of them.  Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently.  I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats).  It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up.  I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms.  But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling.  Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless.  That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever.  I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress).<br /><br />But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal).  So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product.  I paid $18 for 4 ounces!  I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently.  The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before.  The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned.  I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium!<br /><br />Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log!

777,"I haven't tried this tea yet, but the description is a little misleading.  When it is said that this cake can make 75 servings, what they really mean is that you can have 75 ""Gong-fu"" sessions with this tea.  This type of Chinese tea is typically put into very small Yixing teapots (approx 5-7gr of tea into a 110-120 ml teapot), rinsed once or twice (probably once for this expensive tea), and then poured into teacups.  A very high-quality Puerh (aged ""raw"", not aged ""cooked"") can make anywhere from 5-10 teapots-full of the tea before running out of leaf.  Sometimes even more.  Usually the desired effect of these very-old teas is not exactly how they taste, because often-times they won't taste like much more than flavored water, but instead the ""Cha-Chi"", which is a type of energy or feeling that your body feels when/after drinking these teas.  The feelings can be anything from quite stimulating, to very soothing (almost narcotic).  There are many fakes in the market-place, due to extremely rare occurences of any REALLY good, old raw Puerh tea being found outside of Asia.  Any that are found will definitely command very high prices because this type of tea is usually hoarded in China, Taiwan, and anywhere else that anyone can find any of it available for purchase.  Also, when someone states ""60's Puerh tea"", that is a whole decade of variance to deal with.  Before taking the plunge with Puerh tea, start doing your research.  Puerh tea has really been taking hold of the West in recent years, and now the East is capitalizing on our desires for really good Puerh teas.  There are some very good reliable sources out there, but it usually incurs a monetary learning-curve before you get the hang of who you can trust, and what Puerh teas may be right for you.  BUYER BEWARE!  I hope I am not overstepping any bounds by saying this, but a good place to start learning about Puerh tea would be ""Puerh Tea- A Westerner's Quest"" website.

It's probably more the case that you are going to either love or hate this tea after the first couple of cups (give yourself a couple of cups' worth before passing judgement, so that you don't confuse surprise with dislike). You have as much chance of liking or disliking this tea as you do any other. I personally think Earl Grey has a ""funkier"" smell and taste to it than Lapsang, though that doesn't stop me from drinking it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and start with fresh water in a clean kettle, and a fresh tea-bag in a cup or mug. Even with a mug, my experience has been that the brew time suggested is a little long. Go with 4 rather than 5, and that might help if you are nervous that the tea is going to be especially bitter. Really, this tea, if properly made, is not bitter at all. In fact, I never add sugar or sweeteners to any tea, and Lapsang tastes slightly sweet to me on its own.<br /><br />For a supermarket tea, this is a bargain. I got a 20-count in the grocery store on a 2 for 5-buck sale, and it's hard to beat roughly 12 cents for a pour, for this quality. To give you a comparison, I'm currently curing a Yixing teapot with a premium green tea that ran 40-some dollars for the quarter-pound. Consider that this Lapsang is costing you malt-liquor prices and you may be a bit more charitable with your expectations.<br /><br />And by the way, premium lapsang souchong is out there, but based on reviews I've read on other sites, many drinkers don't find that the taste is significantly enhanced, unlike other teas, which really do tend to get progressively better as the price increases.",1
791,"At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.",1

True, Newman's (RIP) is hardly as dark a roast or as thick a beverage, but the flavor punches through very robustly and is totally superior in the area that counts the most to me -- taste.  It's a lot ""Bold""er than this brand.<br /><br />One of my favorite dark roasts is the Coffee People line, even of decafs, which truly bury the ""Big Easy Bold"" in the taste department, too, even if one drinks the decaf.  Diedrich coffees come to mind as well as clear winners.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled, but I tend to use fewer of the ready-mixed K-Cups brand coffees than employing the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and selecting my own brand and grind.  My current favorite brand of coffee comes from a pair of small roasting houses in Washington state and Alaska.  I keep a couple days' worth ground and ready to put into the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI"">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>s, and there are few pre-packed ground K-Cups that can come anywhere close to the richness of the flavors and choices available if one ""rolls one's own.""<br /><br />I've got nothing against Emeril's, and it's a far superior cup of coffee to anything you'll get in most restaurants.

While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".

It was delicious, and VERY filling -a meal all by itself!  Next time I make it I won't add anything extra, just to see how it tastes that way.*  As it was, I kept adding water and ate on one pot of soup for four days ... (""Pease porrige hot, Pease porrige cold..."") Another reviewer mentioned that the soup was very thick when mixed four to one as recommended, and that is very true.  It could be eight to one and still make a nice soup...  I highly recommend it however you cook it!<br /><br />*I returned to lower the rating from five stars to three.  When I tried making the soup with just water and chopped onions, carrots and celery (no spices or broth), there was no rich flavor whatsoever.  This mix does have a wholesome mix of beans, peas and lentils, but it does not contain any spices or flavorings to make it a true soup mix.

They have never been interested in Kongs and rawhides just only hold their attention for so long.<br /><br />I found these at the store last week and bought a couple.

806,"After FINALLY purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a ""to each his or her own"" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!",1

808,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!",1
809,"I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.

810,"I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since.<br />While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine's problems.<br />After many days of getting used to the machine, I've found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements  on the boxes is a good start, and from there it's up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it's way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I've gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I'm getting the most bang for my buck.<br />Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn't necessarily all the capsule's fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it's possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I've really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven't gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a 'watered-down' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an 'operator problem' (see tip above).<br />Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn't be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you'll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can't tell if I've overdone it a touch).<br />Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any).<br /><br />When it comes to flavors, there's been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O"">Latte Macchiato</a> in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso.<br />For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don't know). Also, there's 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you'd find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino).<br /><br />And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br />And since I'm a money-saving statistics addict, I'm especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you've ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I've ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I've saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks.<br />All in all, if you're not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October '10, they've revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.**<br /><br />In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet.",1

815,"Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch.<br /><br />What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!)<br /><br />I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic...<br /><br />Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market.<br /><br />I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar.",1

817,"I have been enjoying single malt scotch since back in the '70's. For a long time the selection available here in the States was quite limited. My normal choice of glass was a brandy snifter. The recent explosion of available brands of single malt caused me to branch out and try a couple other varities with mixed results. After reading the descriptions of some varities online, I found I just wasn't sensitive enough to discover the aromas and tastes they were experiencing. I was just about to settle back with my old favorite, (Can I name brands here?), Glenfiddich, when I discovered the availability of specialized tasting glasses while searching online.<br /><br />I never thought the shape of a glass could make so much difference! These specialized glasses have opened new doors, or should I say new bottles, to the single malt scotch world for me. Is it the curve of the rim? I don't know.

824,"I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.",0
825,"Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was.<br /><br />This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea<br /><br />Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed ""goji stomach ache"" into google and found threads verifying it.<br /><br />I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas.  I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them.  He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid.  Got home and verified his assertion.<br /><br />Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me.<br /><br />BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry.  You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas.",0
826,"More flavorful than the instant noodle brands sitting on most supermarket shelves, Nong Shim's Big Bowl Noodle Udon is an excellent base for a quick meal.<br /><br />Before you start wagging a finger at me, I know instant udon is no substitute for the real thing. During my years in Japan, I ate bowls of hot noodles: soba, udon, and ramen - shiyo, shio, tonkatsu, miso, and butter corn - among others. On occasion, I ate instant noodles, too. There was a time and place for everything.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive, hot lunch that is relatively healthy (vs. a standard, fast-food combination lunch), Nong Shim is a good start. If sodium is a concern, eat the noodles and leave the broth. Add seasonings, vegetables and either eggs or meat to finish it off.<br /><br />J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, executive editor at Serious Eats, recently posted an article, ""Ramen Hacks: 30+ Easy Ways to Upgrade Your Instant Noodles."" I highly recommend you search out and read the full article because you'll never go back to relying on the flavoring packet alone to make instant noodles.<br /><br />I've distilled his tips down to these four areas:<br /><br />* Simple Add-ins - Miso paste, chili bean sauce, Thai curry paste, Japanese curry powder, fish sauce, harrisa, vinegar and ponzu.<br />* Vegetation - Baby spinach, romaine lettuce, bean sprouts, thinly sliced cabbage, watercress, and scallions ""should wilt in a matter of seconds.""<br />* Eggs - Hard boiled, soft boiled, the egg-drop method, poached eggs and fried eggs.<br />* Simple Simmered Meat - Thinly sliced meats cook in a matter of seconds directly in the pot. Chicken breast, pork tenderloin, or flank steak are all great candidates.<br /><br />In addition to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MOX6RA"">Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon</a>, I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00171FB7I"">Nong Shim Beef and Ginger Bowl</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG"">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Japanese Style Instant Noodles</a>. All of these varieties have great flavor but are mild enough to serve to both kids and adults. Another recommendation is for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQNK5A"">Nong Shim Kimchi Noodle Bowl</a>, which is too spicy for young children but excellent for anyone who enjoys a hotter soup.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.",1
827,"Some of the early reviews for this entree are pretty harsh.  I figured it couldn't be THAT bad so I bought a bunch at the blow out price.  It would have to be pretty bad to be worth less than a buck a box... unless it was inedible of course, and then I'd have wasted $25 or so.  I like Indian food so I took a chance.<br /><br />The first box had me thinking the worst.  I tried it alone, heated of course.  It was not a taste I was used to and, as another reviewer noted, it does look gross.  More importantly, there was grit in it, like sand.  Not a lot but enough to disturb. About every third mouthful I'd crunch on a bit of grit and think ""yuck,"" to myself, ""the bad reviews were right.""<br /><br />But I bought a lot so I persevered.  The next box I mixed with rice.  Definitely an improvement.  More like a real meal and -- surprisingly -- no grit.  A relief.<br /><br />A box or two later I decided to add some cooked chicken.  Even better, and thankfully still no return of the sandy grit.<br /><br />I finished off the first tray (a 6-pack) this way plus with toasted hazel nuts mixed into the last 2 boxes.  Finally got it tasting just right for my palate.<br /><br />With add-ins of your choice this entree can be a pretty nice meal, filling and relatively healthy though high in fat and salt.  Alone as it comes I would only give it three stars, or ""ok"" as the star system rates. That assumes no grit.  I would rate my modified version higher but that's not the product as sold.<br /><br />One other thing I noticed as I started in on the 2nd tray of six entrees is that the spicy hot temperature rose steeply.  The 2nd tray may well have been from a different batch so quality control may be uneven.  At least the sandy grit hasn't made a reappearance.... yet....<br /><br />It turned out to be a chance worth taking for me but I can easily imagine that others may not find it paying off for them even at a rock-bottom asking price.  Your mileage may vary.",1

833,"Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters.  Everyone reacts differently though so to guarantee 100% that you will not get the jitters would be a lie.  When I take it, I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.<br /><br />The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg ""proprietary"" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda.

I'm hoping after it has been used a million times this will improve.<br />- If you try pushing the thing on the counter the little white rubber feet come out. I'm glad I did it before I lifted the machine onto it because I would not have been happy to dump my new coffee toy over.<br />- I feel like it could be a lot sturdier since it is meant to hold a $100+ coffee maker on it.<br /><br />There are a couple pros though, that earned the 3 stars:<br />- It does hold 36 k cups. I read reviews on other products that don't actually hold the number of cups that it claims. At least this one really does.<br />- The black color matches the machine nicely.<br />- It gets those bulky boxes of k cups off of the counter. I still have partial boxes to stow somewhere (since I wanted more than 2 varieties in the drawer) but at least I don't have to keep them handy.<br /><br />All in all I would not buy it again and still might return it.

839,"My dad had a very large pressure sore (bed sore) on his buttocks after spending over 2  months in the hospital. His home-nurse suggested using honey. After researching, I came across Manuka Honey and decided the $28 price tag would be worth it IF it helped.<br /><br />My dad's sore was HUGE and DEEP. Unfortunately, I never photographed it or measured it but it was BIG and infected and very serious.<br /><br />It has been 3 weeks (THREE WEEKS) that my dad has been applying the Manuka Honey on his sore. Every time the sore gets dirty from a bowel movement, the Aide reapplys the honey and dressing. I'm guessing his dressing gets changed 2 to 3 times per day.<br /><br />I see my Dad weekly and at the 3rd week, I was SHOCKED to see the dramatic improvement. The sore is only about an inch in length and not very deep at all when it was about 6 inches long and very deep (I'm guessing at the size since I never measured it.But it was Huge!!).<br /><br />I am a believer. They say, seeing is believing. Well, I have seen, I continue to see, and I truly believe in Manuka Honey. I can't say enough about this product.<br /><br />It is a shame that doctors and pharmacies make consumers pay for medicines when there are alternatives.<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you who are doubtful.

847,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.

852,"If classic chai is your cup of tea, I don't think you'll find one better than Rishi's. My suggestion is to prepare it in the traditional manner, i.e., for every 1 - 1.5 tablespoons of chai, use 1/2 cup of whole milk, 3/4 cup of water, and 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar. Bring the chai and liquids to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for five minutes; I add the sugar after straining (it's supposed to be very sweet; add less if you like). It's really a yummy pick-me-up.<br />Rishi makes a number of organic chai blends, none of which, unfortunately, are available from Amazon at the time of this writing. I'm now going to make a confession: as good as Organic Masala Chai is, I actually prefer the other blends, all of which I prepare in the aforementioned classic manner.<br />One is called Maghreb Mint; it has a green rather than black tea base, and as its name indicates, is spiced differently from a classic chai. This one also tastes best sweetened with white sugar and is delicious. However, I drink a LOT of really fine tea (much of it from Rishi) that should be drunk ""straight up,"" hence I'd rather have my chai ""tea-free"" (a contradiction in terms, I realize). My two absolute favorites are Rishi's rooibos-based chai blends: one is called Rooibos Chai and the other, confusingly enough, Rooibos Chai Caffeine-Free. Since neither of these blends contain (as far as I can tell) caffeine, the choice of names is unfortunate [UPDATE: these have since been renamed ""Rooibos Chai"" and ""West Cape Chai,"" respectively and are both caffeine-free]. The one not designated caffeine-free contains something called ""ramon nut"" which adds a lovely, chocolatey flavor, and which is also an ingredient in another caffeine-free Rishi offering called Rainforest Chai which I also like but which some might find too peppery. These both, I find, taste better sweetened with honey or Volcanic Nectar blue agave nectar rather than sugar.<br />All of the Rishi chais can be found at Whole Foods or direct from Rishi. With any luck, Rishi will start packaging some of these other blends in canisters and Amazon will carry them; they're wonderful!",1

856,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.

Every time I use this flour I get superior results and I've used it for everything: piecrust (the best!), muffins, cakes, as a thickener in sauces and soups and any other use for which a cook needs flour.<br /><br />One mixed flour product I've tried is labelled ""white/whole wheat flour"" and it cannot compare to real whole wheat pastry flour.  True whole wheat pastry flour is more finely milled than traditional whole-wheat flour and has a light texture that always blends perfectly in recipes.<br /><br />Any serious cook needs to try using this flour, if you haven't done so yet.  Prior to finding it on amazon, I had to make trips to specialty health food stores and once bought a 50-pound sack just to avoid running out during our New England winters.

863,"... were a basic flavoring ingredient in the cuisine of ancient Rome and Etruria, used as widely as The Chinese use soya sauce or the Americans use catsup. It may be something of a surprise that the same fish sauce is one of the necessary elements of the Southeast Asian cookery, from Burma to the Philippines. The clear pungent liquid is called 'ngapi' in Burmese, 'nam pla' in Thai, 'nuoc nam' in Vietnamese 'yu chiap' in Chinese, and 'patis' in Tagalog. Tiparos is a good brand, and this is a proper price.<br /><br />The Thais serve ""prik nam pla"" as a condiment on the table for every meal. It's simple 'fish sauce' with chopped Thai chilis, those little hot devils, and chopped coriander weed, commonly called 'cilantro' in parts of the USA. It's indispensable. You can judge the authenticity of a Thai restaurant by whether you are served prik nam pla automatically, or have to ask for it, or can't even get it. In the latter case, you are ethically authorized to walk out without paying your bill.<br /><br />Likewise, any Thai or Vietnamese cookbook that doesn't discuss the uses of fish sauce would be better reserved for starting campfires.<br /><br />As I said, the Romans used the same stuff, which they called LIQUAMEN. My guess is that as the Empire was transformed by immigration from the north, especially via Gaul, fish sauce was replaced by sea salt and rock salt. The Haida, Tlingit, and Kwakiutl peoples of the Pacific Northwest used the oil squeezed from candlefish for a similar taste treat. That oil was so valuable as a trade item that wars were fought over it.<br /><br />Soya sauce is NOT an adequate substitute, whatever your Betty Crocker cookbook says. But now you can get fish sauce anywhere you choose to live. I'm still getting accustomed to the implications of internet shopping. Imagine this: I can get a novel by Roberto Bola&ntilde;os, a DVD opera by Monteverdi, and a bottle of Tiparos nam pla, all in one package delivered to my door by the US Postal Service.",1
864,"We received our order form Amazon last week and it came in an unmarked box with 24 counts in it. There's no expiration date whatsoever imprinted inside or outside of the box, nor is it on the packets themselves. We don't know how long it has been sitting in the warehouse. Judging by the texture of the almond butter upon opening, it must have been quite a while. The texture is rather gritty, and very dry. It's almost hardened and cannot be squeezed out whatsoever. We tried to soften the spread by warming it in the boiling water with pouch intact but it had no effect. It was completely solid when we opened each pouch. You can't squeeze it out. It is VERY difficult to open each foil packet without scissors on hand. Very badly made inside out, in short.",1

Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala ""Take the Skinheads Bowling"" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic ""II & III""; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them ""scratching their heads out loud"" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  ""Camper Vantiquities"", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: ""Seven Languages"" and the Harrison/Starkey composition ""Photograph.""  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper ""phenomenon"" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.

868,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",1

We are supposed to count carbs in order to figure out how much insulin to give at each meal.  When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately.  We have tried it several times with the same result.  I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product.  I won't be buying anymore.  Sorry it took me so long to find out.  It's probably why I couldn't lose weight even though I thought I was counting carbs all this time.",1

(Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).

874,"Saffron comes from the flower of the crocus plant (it's actually the plant's dried stigma) has a reddish thread-like appearance, and is a rich source of carotenoid antioxidants.<br /><br />Used since ancient times for a variety of medicinal purposes (saffron is known for its immune-boosting power, among others), in the modern day it is widely used in Persian, European, Indian and Turkish cooking, both for its unique sweet, grassy flavor and its ability to add vibrant yellow-orange color to foods.<br /><br />There are quite a few studies that reveal saffron's beneficial properties, and one of the most recent showed promise for treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. In a 22-week, double-blind study of patients with Alzheimer's, a saffron supplement worked as well as the drug donepezil (brand name Aricept), but with significantly less vomiting experienced among the saffron group.<br /><br />The researchers noted:<br /><br />""This phase II study provides preliminary evidence of a possible therapeutic effect of saffron extract in the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.""<br /><br />It is becoming increasingly clear that supplementing your diet with foods and supplements rich in a variety of compounds, such as vitamin E, folic acid, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), and ALA (alpha-lipoic acid), may help reduce oxidative stress and delay the progression of age-related cognitive decline. And it appears saffron is no exception.<br /><br />Separate research has shown saffron to help prevent and treat dementia, and inhibit platelet aggregation (which can lead to blood clots) and lipid peroxidation (which causes cell damage). It's also known to have chemopreventive properties against cancer, which are also strongly associated with the common saffron alternative turmeric (which is often referred to as Indian saffron). While in China, Marco Polo in 1280 AD recorded information on turmeric in his diary:<br /><br />""There is also a vegetable which has all the properties of true saffron, as well the smell and the color, and yet it is not really saffron.""<br /><br />So, turmeric has been used as a substitute for saffron (an old world spice) in Europe for over 700 years, and this spice has been found to have many of the same health advantages, including showing promise for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If you've never tried saffron, the reason may be because it's earned the moniker ""most expensive spice in the world."" There are only three stigmas in each crocus flower, and it reportedly takes 80,000 flowers (about the number of plants on one acre of land) to produce one pound of saffron. Turmeric is much easier to come by and is also much less expensive, while offering many of the same potential health benefits, as well as the same characteristic yellow color.",1

It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities.""<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of ""Kombucha-Pure"", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",1

It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long):  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.",1
896,"Okay, yes, they are good. However, when my package arrived, the box had been opened and didn't look full. So, I counted them.  There were 87, not 100.  (and there were none loose in the box among the other items.) I guess the ""box packer"" got hungry and decided to eat a few. not cool.<br /><br />Follow up:  Amazon was great about my complaint about the number!  They sent a new box right away.  thanks! and I would order again.",0

898,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",0

900,I called the company because my concern is how they decaffeinate their product and I was disappointed that they used some solvent (ethanol in the process) rather than the safer CO2 process.  So I ordered ECGC from NOW and its fairly decaffeinated only 4 mg of caffeine and they use the CO2 method.  Do your research.  I think if you are going to take something for your health then it should not have residues which may be undesirable.,1

902,"Dark chocolate is all about marketing and has little to do with quality. Chocolate connoisseurs know better but constitute a small fraction of the gourmet consumer base.<br /><br />Godiva chocolates are delicious and have a wonderful texture. They taste better than Sees Chocolates. Unfortunately, they just don't satisfy my chocolate craving.<br /><br />It's a shame what qualifies as chocolate here. In the US, dark chocolate must contain 15% chocolate liquor; European rules require 35% cocoa solids. American milk chocolate must contain 10% chocolate liquor; European standards require 25% cocoa solids. That means American milk chocolate is 90% not. No wonder those drug store easter chocolates taste so horrible.<br /><br />The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike. I doubt real vanilla costs that much more per box of chocolates.<br /><br />Get a Valrhona pure chocolate bar (see other comments on where to purchase or buy conveniently from Amazon). They make one which contains 85% cocoa!",1
903,"After reading prior reviews I felt confident about placing this order since people mentioned next day delivery.  But I did it late in the day on a Friday (for a birthday the following Wednesday) and was perturbed to see the order wouldn't go out until the following week.  Then I got an acknowledgement email that said it would not ship until Tuesday, with a two to six day delivery window, i.e., Thursday at the earliest.  Sigh!<br /><br />To my amazed and more-than-pleased surprise, the flowers were actually delivered on Tuesday!  According to my sister, they come direct from Honduras, Holland or Costa Rica ... hers came from Honduras.  And that's the small part of this five-star rating.<br /><br />The flowers were absolutely fresh, lavish/plentiful, beautiful, with wonderful colors ... everyone in her office raved about them, with one woman able to specifically identify a special Honduran rose she was familiar with.  The price is great, too, especially in view of what you get.<br /><br />I certainly know where I will be ordering flowers in the future.  My sister, too.

904,"I truly love the flavor of this soup mix but it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil.  That means it has 'trans fats' that effectively cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease.  That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.  Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers.  And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.  As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix, I can not recommend it to anyone!  I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb' ever again.  Eat it at your own risk!!!",0
905,"I am not a big fan of fruit roll-ups as they tend to be more like candy than fruit with added sugar. These Twisted Fruit ropes are a ""whole"" other story.

It's SO GOOD that I enjoy it as much as my children do ! So far, I have had the pleasure of trying the strawberry, sour apple, and tropical fruit twists. I love them all although the sour apple is indeed ""sour"". It will make your mouth pucker which I personally love but I buy the strawberry & tropical flavors for my children. I just wish that they were less expensive but I can see how they cost more to produce so I am willing to pay more to get a better, more nutritious fruit snack !

907,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net.  What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.  People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage.  It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food.  What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.  It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food.  The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).  I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One.  It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.  Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result.  It's worth it.",1

Simply put, Heinz's reduced sugar & reduced carb ketchup tastes just like regular Heinz ketchup, making me wonder why Heinz doesn't make all its ketchup this way.  Anyway, this controlled-carb enthusiast is now regularly enjoying ketchup on his (alas, still mostly bunless) burger patties again; just using mustard was getting a little tiring.  While some low-carb versions of previously favorite foods take some getting used to, this one doesn't, so don't hesitate to order this product.  The price isn't all that bad, either.",1
911,"Saffron is unusually difficult to find in my local market so I've been trying out several different varieties available here on Amazon...nothing beats the flavor of Saffron!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one since it is packaged in an acrylic box (unlike Frontier brands which is a competitively priced slightly more expensive version that uses pouches that smell like a pool liner - argh!). The price was suspiciously low so I thought I'd give it a try with the hope of finding an affordable alternative.<br /><br />Unfortunately this simply doesn't measure up even to that of the Frontier brand. While the packaging is STRONGLY preferred...this simply wasn't fresh enough. The flavor was a bit more mild and it required more than double the quantity I've been using for a simple rice dish with the other brand.<br /><br />Notice the expiration date...2017. As of this writing in early 2010 it is good to know the use by date is not near. On the other hand, a seven year window leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />Bottom Line - Preferred packaging but less fresh than ""other"" brand sold here on Amazon. However, other brand uses less desirable liner that lingers. I'm still searching for a good alternative and will report when I find one.",1
912,"A number of reviews have remarked that the bag smelled fermented or like vinegar when opened. I experienced the same thing, and being a first time consumer of cacao nibs, specifically this brand, I was concerned that I received a bad batch. Upon further research, I learned that fermentation is a necessary part of cacao processing, used to reduce astringency and develop the flavor we associate with chocolate. Fresh cacao seeds have no chocolatey flavor at all. So, much like my first real piece of Roquefort cheese, I learned that this can be surprising in smell and taste to those of us who have only ever had the overly processed derivatives. While it is possible that some really did receive a compromised product, I found no detectable rancidity or otherwise off flavors in mine. I do pour the nibs into a bowl so they breath a little and this helps to dissipate the fermented aroma when I am eating some plain.<br /><br />This is an item you do not want to buy in quantity until you have a chance to sample first (like that case of vegetarian canned chili I once ordered.)<br /><br />I enjoy the product and plan to incorporate into a trail-mix type bar for some extra flavor.",1

It's rather startling at first and takes a little getting used to, but after a day or two it's okay, as long as you've placed it somewhere that it won't bother you to have very bright light. I notice that they sell wall units on which you can place up to three Aerogardens. I can barely imagine how bright the room would be after installing three of these things in one place. I certainly wouldn't want any more lighting in the room. I might even put a screen in front of it to soften the light.",1

921,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0
922,"Disclosure: I don't own any of these specific CFLs.  These Earthmate bulbs may be somewhat smaller than the usual CFL of this wattage which would of course be great in small fixtures.  But...<br /><br />Because this bulb is being promoted by Amazon as part of a 10 product ""green"" package and the *very* next thing on their list is a dimmer switch, I think it should be pointed out that conventional CFLs such as these DO NOT work and play well with dimmers.  The Earthmate site currently lists three (only) of their bulbs that are dimmer compatible, and this is not one of them.<br /><br />There are specific types of compact fluorescents (usually even more expensive than these ;-) called CCFLs (Cold Cathode...) that *do* work with dimmers, last even longer than regular CFLs and have less mercury to boot.  You can identify them visually by noting the significantly smaller diameter of the light tube and generally more turns.<br /><br />While I'm at it, 2700K is to my eye significantly more yellow than the typical incandescent (tungsten) light bulb.

Symptoms include tremors, incoordination, elevated body temperature, increased aggressive behavior, and disruption of learning. Laboratory tests suggest that permethrin is more acutely toxic to children than to adults.<br /><br />The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified permethrin as a carcinogen because it causes lung tumors in female mice and liver tumors in mice of both sexes. Permethrin inhibits the activity of the immune system in laboratory tests, and also binds to the receptors for a male sex hormone. It causes chromosome aberrations in human and hamster cells.<br /><br />Permethrin is toxic to honey bees and other beneficial insects, fish, aquatic insects, crayfish, and shrimp. For many species, concentrations of less than one part per billion are lethal. Permethrin causes deformities and other developmental problems in tadpoles, and reduces the number of oxygen-carrying cells in the blood of birds.<br /><br />Permethrin has been found in streams and rivers throughout the United States. It is also routinely found on produce, particularly spinach, tomatoes, celery, lettuce, and peaches. A wide variety of insects have developed resistance to permethrin. High levels of resistance have been documented in cockroaches, head lice, and tobacco budworm.<br /><br />[...]",0

These little packets and tiny jars are ridiculously priced for what you are getting, and beside that most people arent using enough yeast in their baking either. I use yeast for everything from bread to pancakes to corn bread. I use more than most people do. Unlike baking powder and soda, yeast is actually nutritional (as long as it is cooked, never eat it uncooked). Yeast adds a nice flavor and aroma not found in these 'powders'. I don't know where some of the common practices for using yeast came from, but I've found that you don't need to let things rise two or three times unless, that is, you are looking for a way to pass time. Also like in pancakes, just mix up the batter and throw it on the griddle, it rises for me. But don't be so stingy with the yeast. Yeast is not some rare thing that needs to be conserved, actually it is cheaply made, yet yeast boasts rather high nutritional value.<br />  I may be biased, I rarely if ever bake with white flour, I use whole wheat, corm meal or perhaps rye, mostly whole wheat. I use egg in my dough, batter etc., rather than the added white flour for gluten.

929,"I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.",0

932,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests.

940,"My first impression is not the initial taste on the tip of my tongue as first expected, but the powerful, almost peppery taste at the back of my throat as I sip this one down. On the second sipping, more on the tip of my tongue this time, the tea's more subtle qualities come through: the mellow side of the lemon and ginger combination--then wham again with the peppery snap at the back of my throat. This is no mildly flavored herbal, but one directly infused with ginger root, lemon peel, lemon grass and blackberry leaves. One other interesting ingredient is linden, a plant with many medicinal properties and used for such for many centuries. It would be interesting to know if it is the linden flower that is used (and most probably it was), since this is a diaphoretic, a very mild fever-inducing part of the plant when taken as a hot tea. This naturally enables the body to help fight off infections according to some sources I looked up on the web. Not to worry though--this is not a fever that will keep you from work! It's one that will make your body work for you instead.<br /><br />I bought this one for some relief from a sore throat and it definitely helps ease my sinus induced problem. As with any lemon-flavored beverage I've tried, it does leave a slight aftertaste of lemon, but not too strong or unpleasant. I imagine it would be quite good with honey, which I will definitely try once I get home from work. For now, a slight bit of sugar seemed to compliment the flavors nicely, even bringing them out more. This is a strong flavored herbal, not a mellow one as I've come to expect a lot of herbals to be. Drink with caution if you like your herbals on the softer side. This one's courting the wilder side of the tea experience.",1
941,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
942,"Actually, I'm more disappointed with my research into unrefined coconut oil than this product.  Through my internet research, I was assured that this product would take care of my cholesterol.  After eating 3 tablespoons every day for a couple of weeks, I noticed that I was becoming very lethargic and I started to have chest constrictions.  I was also giving a spoonful to my 4 year old daughter.  When I saw my daughter start acting dumb, it confirmed that my lethargy wasn't accidental.  I quickly stopped giving her and myself any coconut oil to eat.  I don't exercise enough but my daughter runs around like a top all the time.  She gets plenty of exercise and this seemed to slow her mental abilities regardless of exercise.  My chest constrictions have gone after two weeks without coconut oil.  We only use it to moisterize dry skin.<br /><br />Right after I doubted the effects of this product on cholesterol, I did a more thorough internet search and discovered that blood types O did not do well with coconut oil and it is best to avoid it.

943,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",1

946,"Although often used as a quasi-blend name (particularly in connection with Indian and Ceylonese teas), ""orange pekoe"" is in fact a reference to a black tea's grade. Loose leaf black teas come in two basic groups - whole leaf and broken; in addition, there are ""fannings"" and ""dust,"" the lower-grade remainders usually found in tea bags. Whole leaf tea grades are as follows (top quality within a grade is denoted by adding the number 1):<br /><br />* Orange Pekoe (OP):<br />Long, thin, pointed leaves (larger than FOP, see below), rolled lengthwise and picked when the final buds open into leaf. Rarely contains ""tips,"" i.e. the very ends of the bud's leaves, which constitute a guarantee of quality. Produces a light or pale color. The predominant whole leaf grade in Ceylon and Java.<br /><br />* Pekoe (P) and Flowery Pekoe (FP):<br />Short, fleshier and less refined leaves without tips. Produces a stronger color than OP; found mainly in Ceylon and Southern India, but also in parts of Kenya.<br /><br />* Flowery Orange Pekoe (FOP):<br />Fine, delicate, young leaves with a certain proportion of tips. Second grade tea in Assam, but top grade in most Chinese regions.<br /><br />* Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (GFOP):<br />FOP with ""golden"" tips (tips of the particularly fine, golden-orange variety).<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (TGFOP):<br />FOP with many golden tips; the predominant grade in Darjeeling and Assam.<br /><br />* Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (FTGFOP):<br />Outstanding golden-tipped FOP.<br /><br />* Special Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (SFTGFOP):<br />Highest grade FOP with a large share of golden-tipped leaves; very rare.<br /><br />Broken leaf ratings correspond to those for whole leaf teas, i.e.:<br /><br />* Broken Orange Pekoe (BOP):<br />Less refined black leaf tea; the main broken grade in Ceylon, Southern India, Java and China. Produces a rich color and full-bodied taste. BOP1 (sometimes designated FBOPF - Finest Broken Orange Pekoe Flowery) is primarily found in the lower districts of Ceylon's tea-growing areas and consists of approximately 40 % OP and 60 % Pekoe and/or BOP.<br /><br />* Golden Broken Orange Pekoe (GBOP):<br />Less refined broken grade; inhomogeneous leaves, some tips.<br /><br />* Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (FBOP):<br />Less refined broken tea with some tips from Assam, Ceylon, Indonesia, China or Bangladesh.<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Broken Orange Pekoe (TGBOP):<br />Refined broken grade with a substantial number of golden tips.<br /><br />* Golden Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (GFBOP):<br />Top broken grade in Assam and the only tippy broken grade from Kenya.<br /><br />* Tippy Golden Flowery Broken Orange Pekoe (TGFBOP):<br />Highest-grade broken leaves in Darjeeling and some parts of Assam. High tip content and uniform leaves.<br /><br />Twinings Orange Pekoe is an invigorating Ceylonese blend with a distinctive flavor: Nothing to splurge on, but a reliable choice for every day.",1

You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these ""pill hiding treats"" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking.

Needless to say, these ""pill pockets"" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks. Just enough time for use to become complacent as far as the daily pill act was concerned.<br /><br />Sure enough, we were once again outsmarted by the cat. Approximately two weeks into the ""pill hiding treat"" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several ""pill hiding treats"" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is. Although we never put it in the very first one, or the very last one.

951,"As a bodybuilder, I have been looking for a cheaper alternative to the Twin Labs Liquid Amino Fuel. I was considering the Bragg. I have not tried the Bragg. However, there is one major flag with the Bragg. The nutritional label. Even on the Bragg web site it confirms 110 mg of sodium. 110 per serving. That is a ton of salt.

This product is not to be used in that context, which I learned. I'm glad my review will clarify the usability of the product for ""those seeking an amino supplement while undergoing strenuous workout regiments and training"". I believe Bragg should consider a clarification on the label. It's an excellent product as a selective, minor boost of amino supplementation in accordance to recipe augmentation and flavoring. But, not in terms of dosing. I'm sorry for any confusion my review may have caused. My perspective came from a different interpretation based off Braggs label description which actually motivated me to purchase the product because my dietary and monthly supplementary costs are staggering since I'm natural, and this product is affordable.

954,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0

I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 120<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market!",1

961,"I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable.  Also, coconut ""oil"" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated.  Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it.<br /><br />You cannot ""eat it out of the jar"" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve.  I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up.",0
962,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price.",0
963,"I had to start eating more healthy and after years of eating poorly, it's just not easy to change. I had to learn to add more protein and fiber into my diet but watch the calories and fat. So bacon and sausage for protein at breakfast was totally off the table. Finding a GOOD tasting cereal that gave a significant amount of protein wasn't easy. Then add to that one with good fiber content too! And lets not forget the most important fact....I had to like it! Eating healthy is NOT easy! You need to do your research! I finally found Kashi Go Lean, Honey Almond after 6 months. At the store near me, they don't keep it in the cereal section so I just happened to see it off in the corner one day and gave it a look. I thought I was going to HATE it so it sat in the cabinet for a couple of weeks.....but was I surprised when I finally had some! It has the right amount of sweet and a one cup portion is so filling! I'm fulfilling my protein and fiber requirements and it doesn't even have to hurt! It also makes an awesome snack too....and its good for me!<br /><br />I'm currently trying to get my grandchildren to eat more healthy too before its too late. (2 yr old and 4 yr old boys) This cereal is awesome mixed with some oatmeal and they love it. They also love snacking on it. I also see a big difference after taking them off those sugar charged breakfast cereals they used to eat.<br /><br />Honestly, Kashi Go Lean saved my life. With it's help I've lost 80 pounds and am near my goal weight. It helps my sweet tooth and the fiber helps in ways we all know! Thank you Kashi!",1

969,Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.,1
970,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors?

971,"Not very happy with this one, which really doesn't happen very often for me, since I'm forgiving.

I mean, I understand when the picture isn't the same, but a deceptive product description? C'mon!<br /><br />First off, I'm unsatisfied because I received my product broken up and smashed around in the box with all the brown confetti, rendering it ungiftable without effort.<br />If I wanted to exert effort, I would have gone to the store and gathered things myself & fashioned them into a basket.<br />They did, however, provide me with a ""DeliDirect"" catalogue, coupon, and random green tortes I didn't order (perhaps added as an apology)....<br /><br />Secondly, I really ordered this for the cheese, for a cheese lover.<br />BUT the cheeses DO NOT come in 4oz blocks as advertised (instead 2oz x 2ea flavor), and they are all PROCESSED CHEESE FOOD. Not cool.<br />This means we get to eat it instead.. did a taste test, it's all plastic same-flavor stuff, but higher quality than Velveeta, if that's a consolation.<br />I will make note of anytime I see the word ""flavor"" when ordering cheese in the future. Since I saw ""Wisconsin"" advertised everywhere, I expected the real deal, even if ""sub par"" but NOT processed...<br /><br />This brings me to the third strike, the meat products were NOT the flavors they said were included - garlic, mesquite, & original.<br />Instead, it was 1 salami, and 2 original summer sausages, one just in the plastic, and one in the plastic as well as a special paper sack?! Was this to trick me into thinking it was a different flavor?<br /><br />Overall, three strikes you're out DeliDirect (ahem, amazon), I hate dealing with complications in mail order stuff, this is lame & means my family ""wins"" the prize.<br /><br />><br /><br />Main reason I'm posting....

972,"I saw this in a specialty market and was so impressed by the wide ribbons of white coconut that I disregarded the gazillion dollars they charged and bought a bag.  At the Bob's Red Mill website, I investigated recommended recipes and found an enticing cookie recipe, then assembled the ingredients and prepared a batch of wholesome, chewy, flavorfully delicious cookies which we've been enjoying for a few days.  I'd used home dried cherries and grapes (raisins) instead of the cranberries listed in the recipe, but otherwise followed it as written online and on the Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Cereal bag.  The coconut was so impressive that I immediately checked to see the Amazon price in preparation for buying more and after only a week, they now have it in stock at a much better price than the nearly five I paid for my first bag.  The 12 ounce bag probably contains 3 hefty cups of coconut as I split it with my daughter and nibbled some before measuring it for review.  She made fresh blueberry coconut ice cream with coconut milk and said this coconut was especially nice because the texture was more interesting than smaller shreds which she'd used in the past.  Nothing is added to the Bob's Red Mill Flaked Coconut Unsweetened and that's just what I want!  Toasted, it's even better when added to fruit and yogurt.  I have it in my Amazon cart ready to order!",1

980,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.",0
981,"I'm glad I ordered this without reading the negative reviews, but even if I had at least I have the reading comprehension to understand that the two things most people are complaining about are actually listed IN THE DESCRIPTION. Who buys something online without reading the description first? Honestly...<br /><br />1. Yes it comes in a brown paper/zip lock bag. Whoop de doo. You could still give it as a gift, just get your own cellophane bag and tie it off with ribbons. If you have a lot of friends with keurig machines you'd be able to pick a couple flavors for each friend, and it would be adorable to do a little gift bag with a coffee cup and these.<br /><br />2. Yes some of the coffees were ones I don't like, and yes some of them were repeats, that's what happens when you order a grab bag. It flat out states in the description that you will most likely NOT get 1 pack of each of the flavors, and that the flavors listed are EXAMPLES, you are not guaranteed which ones you will receive.<br /><br />If you can't accept those two ""downsides"" don't get this product. Instead try Keurig K-Cups Travel The World Sampler Pack (35 K-Cups) Those are supposedly the same every time, and the gift box is supposedly adorable. Twice the price, but hey, if it's what you're looking for...<br /><br />As for myself, all of the cups arrived in fine condition. Yes I did get an overage of a particular flavor(I'm really fortunate that I love hazelnut coffee) but I liked that many of them were multiples. Since I live with my boyfriend this mean that we can each try a cup of the flavors with extras. And if we don't like one we can save it for when company comes, someone we know will probably enjoy the cup.<br /><br />As a service that allows you to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy a box of each this was cheap and pretty effective. I'll be purchasing again, and next time I'll be sure to come on here and put in which flavors I get, I didn't write them down this time, and they're all mixed in with some other samplers now.",1
982,"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!",1

I heated up 12oz of water (directions say 8oz) in my large coffee mug in the microwave for 3:30. After it was piping hot I added the first packet which has the miso in it. Stirred it around then added the second packet which has the tofu and seaweed. Give it 20 seconds to all mix together and took a sip.<br /><br /> The taste is absolutely amazing. I was not expecting it to taste so good. I highly highly recommend this soup. Plus the price is fantastic. I have it auto-shiped so I saved the extra 15%.

We order these variety packs for quick meals on the go and never get sick of them (although the wife doesn't like the spinach one and says it looks like a poopy diaper... but more for me!).",1
991,"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.",1
992,"I was looking for a chicken/duck dog treat that isnt made in China (most of the popular ones state that they are on their packaging). This one, with its dual French/English labeling and Free Range title, appeared to be a North American free-range organic-type natural product. Especially given the price. But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives. I feel duped, and I am returning.  I can get the same China-quality for half the price without being taken for a ride.",1
993,"I have used this product before in the calcium/magnesium blend. It was suppose to be tasteless.  It wasn't.  It tastes awful.  This lemon-raspberry tastes okay and the product is more reactive when the hot water is added.<br /><br />I was medically advised to take my magnesium in this form because of slipped disks in my back.  This is only one piece of my back program however I can attest to the efficacy of the product.  My disks are no longer slipped.  It has helped me to heal.<br /><br />A bonus benefit for me is that taking the magnesium in this form has stopped the migraines that I have had for 36 years of my life.  I have learned that if a headache begins that I need a dose of Natural Calm.  I was dealing with a magnesium deficiency.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone with muscle or joint issues, migraines,and back issues.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE"">Natural Calm Raspberry Lemon Flavor 16oz, Natural Vitality</a>",1

995,"I do quite a bit of baking, and when a recipe calls for milk, I usually add dry milk powder to the dry ingredients and then add water for the liquid. Over the years, I've tried many different dry/instant milks. This is the best!<br /><br />The convenient pouch is resealable, and easy to open wide enough to insert a measuring cup. To me, that is preferable for measuring over a small pour spout. The milk powder itself is silky in texture, and dissolves quickly. It doesn't seeem to lump and clump like many do. The flavor is excellent, like all Organic Valley products.<br /><br />While I don't personally reconstitute dry milk for drinking by the glass, for those who do, this could be a good choice due to the ease in dissolving and the fine flavor.<br /><br />Because the seal is quite secure, it is also more shelf stable than most. This has earned an ongoing place in my pantry.",1
996,"For those of us who want to cook these noodles using traditional Japanese cooking techniques; here are the instructions:<br /><br />Traditional Cooking Instructions for Japanese Noodles: You can boil the noodles as you would any other pasta or you can use the traditional Japanese style of cooking noodles, which takes a little longer but is well worth the effort. This method is referred to as the shocking method, cold water is added to boiling water several times during the cooking process, creating a more firm, tastier noodle. For this method, place 2 quarts of cold water in a large pot, cover and bring to a boil. Remove the cover, add the noodles and stir to prevent sticking. As soon as the water comes to a boil again, add enough cold water to stop the water from boiling (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup). Bring to a boil again, and add cold water again. Repeat one or two additional times until the noodles are done. Periodically check the noodles by removing a strand and biting or cutting it in half. If the center of the noodle strand is white and the outside is darker, the noodles are not done. When the center of the noodle is the same color as the outside, and the noodles are firm yet tender to the bite they are done. Rinse Japanese noodles under cold water to prevent clumping.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Eden doesn't include the instructions on the package but they are on their website.<br /><br />Yes, I put a little peanut oil in the water and do the cool/boil 3 times over the 8 minute cooking time.  I made my own Tsuyu sauce because it's much less expensive than the prepared suace and easy enough to do.  The recipe is simple:<br /><br />3 cups dashi (bonito and konbu (kelp))<br />1 cup dark soy<br />1 cup mirin (or sake with 3/4 cup sugar)<br /><br />It lasts for months in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Enjoy...",1
997,"Do NOT buy this product unless you enjoy eating sand. It tastes like regular peanut butter with beach sand mixed in. It actually made me gag. What a waste of money. I'm so angry, I am going to contact the maker. BLECH!",0
998,"I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you.",1
999,"I was a real fan of this line of dog treats until one day, I noticed on the back of the bag, the fine print, that read, ""MADE IN CHINA"". How can a dog treat that states cage free chickens and all natural come from China? Its rare to hear of a cage free chicken coup in China of all places. And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least. I have since found better alternatives that I can be more comfortable in giving my dog, such as Plato Natural Organic Chicken made here in the USA.",1
1000,"From the recent reviews mine will not be popular.<br /><br />1.  This honey is incredibly expensive for a very small amount, even less than noted in the ad.<br />2.  I buy unfiltered, unheated,  unprocesseed raw honey from many countries and areas all must be without proximity to flowers with pesticides and or abominations.  This honey states (if you can wade through the UMF stuff, in very small print, that it is filtered to remove particles.  I want the pieces of comb, I want the pieces of pollen, I want the natural particles that came from the comb to the jar - the pure enzymes etc.  Further, this honey is heated albeit limited according to the fine print.<br />3.  The material in the four page pamphlet is very limited focusing on the UMF +20 designation which is supposedly very important.  The first page is just pictures and the name of the honey and company.  The second page is white small print on a pale yellow background which makes for very difficult reading.  I like that the honey comes from isolate protected trees far from any farming and contaminants.  The third and fourth pages are more on this UMF +20 stuff.<br />5.  TASTE - the honey, if you are new to it, has very distinctive flavor because of the unique tree from which the honey is collected.  It has a slight off (a hint of bitterness maybe) flavor.  I liked it.<br /><br />Overall you get limited clear information on how they process the honey, and the cost is outragous compared to many other raw, unfiltered, unheated, unprocessed comb to jar honey where you get four or more times as much at a fraction of the cost with most if not all the same health healing benefits.  Also, the brochures talks about the lack of peroxcides.  I have never heard of this before and question what it means in a practical sense. I will not buy again.",0

1008,"I'd like to be the first to congratulate Skippy on reducing the size of its product from 18oz to 16.3oz. This demonstrates the same proactive business philosophy as its continued use of trans fats. However, I am forced to deduct 4 stars for the inclusion of .3oz of unnecessary peanut butter. Since 16oz is a comfortable number for consumers it is completely unacceptable to include more than 15.5oz. This is especially unfortunate since Skippy already sells its ""natural"" peanut butter in 15oz jars. Fortunately, we can look forward to this 16.3oz jar being phased out for the already introduced 12oz size. Someday soon I hope to see consumers buying a two dozen of 1.2oz jars of 25% pure peanut butter for only one week's wages.",0
1009,"Without giving away too much information on my advancement in years, I may say that I was a child of the 70's and recall with great fondness and slight nausea the intemperate consumption of many of the candies contained within this gift basket.  At almost five pounds, this basket not only represents a good deal, but also the potential for hyperglycemic diabetic coma for the unaware and foolish.  Of course, most of those who would actually be nostalgic for 70's candy would be in their thirties and forties, and thus have sense enough to not indulge to the point of fatality.<br /><br />As I gleefully pulled out the contents of this basket I was struck by how many of these candies were either metaphors or candy copies of nonpharmaceutical and, in many cases, highly addictive and illegal drugs.  The most obvious examples are the cigarette candies.  Since when was cigarette smoking considered exemplary behavior to be modeled in candy form to encourage impressionable youngsters?  Granted, they may be novelty candies and claim innocent fun, but I'm sure the Surgeon General would not be overly pleased at the kid-targeted promotion of a habit that increases both mortality and morbidity for millions and incurs health care costs in the billions.  But that's not the worst of it.  Can anyone claim that candy buttons are anything other than practice in the consumption of LSD blotter paper?  Pixy Stix are long tubes filled with pixy dust, which in actuality is flavored sugar but metaphorically represents angel dust or PCP.  Like PCP, pixy dust can be sprinkled on other confections to enhance their effects.  Wax fangs are just softer versions of real fangs, and real fangs are used to pierce skin, just like hypodermic needles.  Likewise, licorice pipes are only one step away from both marijuana and crack pipes.<br /><br />Looking back at the candies of my youth I began to wonder of a possible conspiracy between confectioners and drug pushers (especially the tobacco companies).  I seem to recall a shredded bubblegum product called ""Big League Chew"" and a cooked extract from unripe poppy seed pods called ""Opium Den Smoke""--more evidence of a possible conspiracy and the perfect opportunity for the FBI to step in and apply the RICO statutes to bust this putative criminal collusion wide open.",0
1010,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

As of 2008, there have been no large scale, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials that show the ingredients, other than caffeine, in these ""proprietary blends"" actually work in healthy humans as advertised. When pressed, the manufacturers cannot come up with the data that support their hype. To date, only good ol' caffeine is the only over-the-counter drug that does what people who buy these overpriced snake-oils desire. So, save your money.

I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines.",1

1035,"When I learned about the many benefits and uses of coconut oil I had to try it, so I ordered 2 jars -one for my pantry for cooking/smoothies etc. and one for my bathroom to use as a body cream. Since I didn't know what brand to choose and didn't have any prior experience with coconut oil I decided to get one jar of the NUTIVA brand and one jar of the NATURE'S WAY brand.<br /><br />Here's my initial opinion of both: With my Nutiva jar there's a sticker indicating the expiration date and package/creation date of the actual oil, whereas with my Nature's Way jar there's nothing like that. When I opened both of them up to try and to just generally check them out I tasted a tiny amount of both and it was very clear that the Nutiva jar's coconut oil tasted much better. I'm not sure exactly why, but to me the Nature's Way coconut oil didn't taste as good, it was kind of toasty in a bad way.<br /><br />It was very easy for me to decide to use the Nutiva brand coconut oil for my cooking and in my smoothies and the Nature's Way coconut oil for my skin. I've since read that this difference in taste could be because the Nutiva brand coconut oil was fresher and the Nature's Way older. Or it could be quality, I'm really not sure. But I am sure that from now on I'm going to just be buying the Nutiva brand Coconut Oil (just ordered 2 more big jars of it). :)<br /><br />To say that the Nature's Way coconut oil was toasty still isn't exactly the right word -toasty sounds like something good... when it's so not, but I really can't think of a better word to describe the difference.<br /><br />I've found a lot of uses for coconut oil and have used it for many things with great results so far. It's hard to believe one little oil can do so much! Weird actually, but everything I've tried it with so far has had positive results.<br /><br />So here's a list of weird, random, but completely amazing things I've found coconut oil to do:<br /><br />-Works better than any make-up remover: seriously, just use a nickle size amount or less on your eyes to get all eye make-up off in a flash.<br /><br />-Helps clear up acne: One night after using it to take off my eye make-up I decided to use it as an all over face make-up remover... then decided my face felt so good I didn't want to use anything else (hint: leave the coconut oil on your face for a minute and then get your water and washcloth really really hot to wipe it all away). I googled to see if this was okay to do and it turns out coconut oil can help get rid of acne! You can use it as a facewash. Strange but true. BUT I also found out that Castor Oil works even better for this (and like coconut oil still moisturizes your face and keeps it from drying out), so I've ordered a small bottle of that to use instead in the future... but still, coconut oil has worked really well for me and apparently others. When you have skin like mine (I'm 25) that occassionally breaks out but still is a little dry sometimes it's hard finding the right balance and exactly the right thing to use -I feel like now I've figured out some great secret to getting it right.<br /><br />-You can use it as a deoderant: This one I read online and decided to try on a day where I wasn't really doing anything or working out. It felt weird -like I was putting some kind of lotion or body creme under my arms instead of my normal Secret deoderant. But guess what? It worked! I have since been trying it on days where I actually do work out and it STILL is working. Craziness! It keeps me dry and smelling good the same as my old deoderant did. AND there's no aluminum zirconium (have no idea how to spell that correctly) which I know is now supposedly bad for you (most deoderants still use it though) because it's connected/correlated with Alzheimers. So... an all natural, organic, one ingredient deoderant that feels like a body creme -doesn't get much better than that! Plus my underarms are looking softer/nicer. :)<br /><br />-You can use it on your scalp and hair: Now I've tried this several times and although I DO like the way it moisturizes my hair, I don't like the way my hair looks after I wash it out... it's just kind of lanky/heavy. Not in an extreme way or anything, but I like my hair to have lots of body. So while I do recommend coconut oil to help heal frazzled hair and stimulate hair growth I don't recommend doing it right before any big event in your life... maybe like a few days before so you get the benefit of the moisturized, healthy hair, without any worries about styling it. This is another one where I've looked it up and found that Castor Oil when massaged in the scalp can stimulate hair growth/fast hair growth even better -so now that I've got that bottle on the way to me from amazon I'll probably be using that instead, at least on my scalp.<br /><br />-You can use it as a body creme and even a BODY WASH. Yepp. A body WASH. Sounds crazy, but it makes my skin look SO good. Better than it's ever looked actually. Coconut oil has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties (and of course is moisturizing) and will clean your skin while hydrating it. So no harsh chemicals or detergents touch your skin -and if you have sensitive skin like I do, well this stuff might just be your new best friend, must-have, can't live without it ever, stuff! I used to have a minor skin problem on my arms that I absolutely hated. Just general redness, sensitivity, and tiny little red dots on the tops of my arms (that I've had since childhood). Now I absolutely don't -and it's literally all because of coconut oil. Maybe it's because I'm not putting soaps/bodywash on my skin anymore or maybe it's because coconut oil is really that awesome, but it has basically cured my arms and has made the skin all over my body look amazing! I seriously can't believe how good it makes my skin look! The best thing to do is to literally use it like a body wash all over -rinse off and then either just towel dry and go or towel dry and then reapply again if your skin is dry or it's winter or you live in a dry climate. When you reapply you're going to have to have some kind of small towel to wipe off excess with before you put on clothes. Either way it makes your skin look great. :) You can also use it to shave with apparently but I haven't tried that. I'm using it to make my own homemade body scrubs and of course using it as a body creme and loving it!<br /><br />-You can feed it to your dogs (one tablespoon a day) to make their coats shiny. (I've been giving it to both my dogs, although not every single day and they love it.<br /><br />-It can help you lose weight. Apparently it has a lot of really GOOD for you fats that your body doesn't treat like other fats and it actually helps you lose weight (learned this from Dr. Oz). Plus it tastes good when you cook with it and put it in smoothies. Actually I LOVE it in smoothies, it just adds an extra tropical coconut flavor. :-)<br /><br />-You can use it for Oil Pulling.<br /><br />-You can use it as a lip balm.<br /><br />Plus I know there's so much more but that's all I can think of right now! Basically it's really good stuff that I am now believing everyone should have in their home! :-)",1
1036,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest.",1

1040,"Enjoyed upon receiving.  Not a night and day difference, but using with scotch seemed to provide a smoother finish and reduce the ""burn"" quality (i drink it neat.)  HOWEVER, after about 5 uses, pressing the button to release the scotch through the aerator no longer worked!  I pressed it several times, to no avail - then held it in place to see if it would eventually free itself, also to no avail... poured the scotch into my glass out of the top, so that i could then shake and smack the aerator and the stopper eventually freed itself.  But the stopper - which appears to be magnetic - has not worked well since, and i would inevitably have to smack it a couple of times prior to pouring to get it to work (since you can't smack it while there's anything in the glass.)  Anyways, I call the manufacturer for a replacement and I have to pay to ship it to them.  They pay return shipping for replacement - fair enough - but i'm still paying extra for dealing with the hassle.  Hopefully the next one will not have this issue, as this seems to be the first mention of this problem.

1047,"I enjoy this product immensely. Good clean flavor, not at all chemical or artificial tasting, and feel-good organic, to boot. BUT, But I must say that I am quite puzzled by the nutrition information on the jar label. According to my label a 1 teaspoon serving has 11 calories, 4 g fat, 1 g carb, and 42 gr protein. This is impossible. 1g fat=9 calories, 1 g carb=4 calories, 1 g protein = 4 calories. So, this product, if it does indeed have the quantities of nutrients that the label says it has, should have 36 fat calories, 4 carb calories and 168 protein calories, with a total of 208 calories per teaspoon. As you see, the label must be incorrect, either with the calorie count or the nutrients count.<br /><br />I took a look at the organic vegetable base and it has a similar disparity in its nutrient/calorie count.<br /><br />So which is it? 11 or 208 calories? It makes a big difference to me, as I am watching my fat and overall calorie intake.<br /><br />To make matters more confusing the Amazon add says ""naturally fat  free. Now I'm even more flummuxed.",1

1051,"Note: Blue Buffalo no longer makes ""Weight Control"" dog food and instead makes ""Healthy Weight"" dog food in the ""Life Protection line.  Healthy Weight has 415 calories per cup and 3.290 calories/gram.  Compared to the Longevity line for adult dogs, Healthy Weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram, meaning that Healthy Weight has more grams per cup than Longevity. Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.<br /><br />Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.<br /><br />Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.<br /><br />Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.<br /><br />The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the ""diet"" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!<br /><br />I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.<br /><br />I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VHZ84A"">Premier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag</a>).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVSPIC"">Zuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats</a> (not to be confused with the 10-calorie each <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055TM554"">Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz</a>. My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.<br /><br />Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food called  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML7S0"">Premium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Pound</a> that has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!)

That was $2,000 wasted.<br /><br />I had no hope. That is, until I found Gorilla Munch. The primary ingredient in Gorilla Munch, Love(tm), provided high enough levels of necessary nutrients to unrustle even my Jimmies! After consulting my doctor, I've received the news that the rustling in my Jimmies is in regression, and I should expect to have completely unrustled Jimmies by August 2012.<br /><br />I cannot thank this cereal enough for what it's done for me.",1

1071,"If you knew how foie gras was produced, you probably wouldn't buy it. Ducks are intensively raised from birth, their toes cut off so that their talons don't have to be maintained. They are manhandled so forcefully that many ducks break wings or legs or sometimes even necks. They are forced into individual cages and remain there, until they are forcefed fat through long metal tubes, to swell their livers. They are given so much food that they struggle to breathe. This happens 3 times a day. Sometimes, the ducks don't survive this maltreatment, and their bodies are thrown into wastebins.<br /><br />I am not a vegetarian but I believe that it is wrong to intensively raise animals in this way. Please show your support and boycott the sale of foie gras.",0

Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

1076,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.  This stuff should be banned.",0

1078,Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.,1

Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA.

I will keep Nestle Nido from chile as a back up and for emergency stock. I also boiled both whole milks and found the Nido performs as well as store bought.

My health improved greatly when I stopped eating soy, but I missed the lecithin.<br /><br />I was happy to discover recently that other types of lecithin were available. One source is sunflowers.  I tried sunflower lecithin capsules, but was less than enthused about them.  Nothing wrong with them, but they felt like an inert food somehow, maybe because of the processing when it's put into the capsules.<br /><br />I found LoveRawFoods Raw Sunflower Lecithin online a few weeks ago and decided to try it. It's a little pricey, not so much the product itself, which is reasonably priced, but when you combine the product price with the shipping, it adds up.  But I'm glad I bought it.  I really love it.  It's great to be able to eat lecithin again after all of these years.<br /><br />To reiterate: sunflower lecithin is not like soy lecithin. Soy lecithin is an industrial waste product marketed for human consumption (made usually from genetically modified soybeans). It's toxic and bad for you.  Sunflower lecithin is a beneficial food product derived from sunflower seeds. And better yet, the LoveRawFoods brand is raw. Very cool.  It tastes like very fresh sunflower seeds.  I'll keep buying it as long as LRF keeps making it.<br /><br />If you're new to lecithin, I'd recommend mixing some into a smoothie, till you develop a taste for it. I actually eat it by the spoonful. But I know that's unusual :)Most people would want to mix it into some food.",1
1119,"I am 34 year-old male who had terrible side effects (severe constipation) from statins while trying to reduce my cholesterol of 234. I had to quit taking them. A friend at work recommended 2 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar with some juice every day. She said her results shocked her doctor after 2 months. She also said it worked for her sister.<br /><br />So, I tried it that night, and also wanted to check it out online, because I'm always a skeptic. What I found was that a LOT of people recommend ACV for a whole range of things that interest me. After reading all I've read, and from my personal experience so far, I'm really diggin it. The only side effects I've seen is the taste, and because it is very acidic, people say you should keep it off your teeth as much as possible.<br /><br />Here's a list of some of the things I've read that it helps dramatically with:<br />Cholesterol, blood pressure, immune system, detoxification, eczema, migraines, headaches & sinus headaches, hair thinning & hair loss, warts, slow steady weight loss, diabetes, depression, insomnia, increased energy & alertness, infections & cancers, the flu, sinus infections & post nasal drips, allergies & asthma, chronic fatigue, sore throats, arthritis, ulcers, bowel problems & IBS, nail fungus, acne, skin problems & complexion. The list goes on and on, to the point where it sounds WAY too good to be true.<br /><br />I read several testimonials from teachers and nurses that used to get sick repeatedly, to the point where they thought they'd have to quit their jobs, until they started taking ACV. They claim they don't get sick anymore at all.<br /><br />Since there really doesn't seem to be any side effects from ACV, I can't think of any reason NOT to try Apple Cider Vinegar. I am curious/anxious to see if it helps with some of my stuff. In particular, I get sick. A LOT. I work in retail and I usually need antibiotics at least 4 times each winter for sinus infections, sore throats and post nasal drips, going back to when I was a kid. Allergies. Cholesterol. More energy and some weight-loss sounds good too! Basically, it seems to clean out your blood and detoxify your body really well, which helps to get the whole machine running like it should.<br /><br />I've only been on it for 14 days as of this writing, and what I can testify about so far is:<br />1. Energy/Alertness. I feel really good so far. Many users claim they feel a very persistent boost of energy within a day, and I certainly felt it too, and it hasn't stopped. I've also been sleeping very well. For at least 10 years, (since about when I had mono) I have always felt like I was in a bit of a brain fog. (No jokes please!) Since taking it these past two weeks, I feel very alert with increased energy. It just FEELS like my body and brain are simply ""on their game"", so to speak.<br />2. Allergies. When I started taking the ACV, my allergies were already bothering me for a bit, and I've been clear as a bell since the first day. Also, every time I go to my in-laws, my allergies go nuts from their dog. I usually have to start popping Benadryl within a half an hour. This past week, I was there for 2 nights and 3 days and didn't even need 1 pill. My sinuses were totally clear! Was it the ACV? Other people said they had similar quick findings, but I don't want to say for sure. Ragweed season is right around the corner, so we'll see how it handles that.<br />3. Complexion. ACV supposedly helps clear it up in a slow but steady fashion. My face was breaking out really bad for the past month when my cholesterol pills screwed up my whole system. In addition, I have always had many blackheads on my nose area, no matter what I washed it with. I poured a little bit of ACV on some paper towel and rubbed the area with it like a Stridex Pad, and within 2 days my facial complexion looks better than it has in years. I've never gotten results like this! Again, is it the ACV? I can't say for sure. It could just be that my body is happy I've stopped doing what I HAD been doing. Watch... I'll probably wake up with a big 'ol zit tomorrow morning!<br /><br />In general, it just feels like I am being detoxed, and natural remedies like this are up my alley. If it helps with just 1 or 2 of these things, with no side effects like my pills gave me- I'll keep at it for a while. I don't want to go around running my mouth until I am positive it is seriously working, but I wouldn't mind hearing if it is working for other people too. So let me know if you try it and what you find, and I'll continue to do the same... I'm a bit of a closet scientist who loves to discuss his data!<br /><br />The only other things I take daily are a Men's One-a-Day vitamin, Activia (yogurt), Claritin (allergy pill), and a fish oil pill (also good for cholesterol & heart health). I've been taking 2 tablespoons of the ACV mixed with very little water, like a shot, and then I chase it with more water. The bad taste is over in less than 5 seconds- No sweat!<br /><br />One thing I've read over and over again, is to NOT buy the regular ACV you find in the store. People say that it has been distilled and filtered to make it look more clear- but that just takes out all the nutrients and potency. They say to look for ""organic"" or ""raw"" from a health store or farm stand, and it is just as cheap. They say that the cloudier it looks, the better.<br /><br />Just Google ""apple cider vinegar"" and you'll quickly find hundreds of user testimonials and advice from around the world, from all types of people. I was skeptical at first, but you have to ask yourself... ""Could ALL these people be morons?"" Or, ""Why would they all lie about a 3 dollar bottle that they aren't making any money from?""<br /><br />There doesn't seem to be much to lose. If it stops working, I'll stop drinking! I'll write another review after my cholesterol check-up within 2 months, and probably another after I see how it does with colds this winter! Good health!!",1

Nutella. Got it in a care package. :D<br /><br />These are seriously perfect for care packages. Double bag them of course in case the whole package gets squashed, but even in hot weather, they should arrive fine and be no worse for the high temperatures, since Nutella is supposed to be semi-liquid anyways.

1123,"Love this formula. All of the nutrition, none of the ridiculous crap.<br />My son started to self-wean around 8 months, which was devastating for me since I know the wonderful benefits of human milk for human babies. I researched a TON--from goat's milk, to raw milk, to every formula under the sun. This was the best option I could find. The ease of not having to refrigerate it, combined with it being the closest to human milk as you can get--even down to tasting slightly sweet. Yes, I tasted it.<br />I love that they have a lactose-free option that isn't soy. Soy mimics estrogen and should not be fed to infant boys. Or girls, for that matter.<br />It does tend to be foamy when you shake it up, but we just scooped it off with a spoon--no biggie. Even if we didn't remove the foam, son didn't get gassy from it.<br />I know it says it's a Toddler Formula for 12 months and up, but that is because the company is a proponent of breastfeeding for the first year.

But, all the negative reviews freaked me out, so I was nervous to try them :)  However, I did follow many reviewers' advice and they were delicious.  No calories, no carbs...I'm in!!<br /><br />Here's what I did. Opened the bag, dumped them in a mesh colander and rinsed, rinsed, rinsed them. Blotted dry on a paper towel. Heated up some olive oil and a little garlic and threw the noodles in. Added what I had on hand: some cooked chicken, cooked diced zuchinni, a little spaghetti sauce and ricotta cheese. Let simmer for maybe 5-8 min. Sprinkled with some parmesan cheese. Really DELICIOUS! My husband even ate some and didn't say a word. I thought they were really good. Mixed in with a bunch of other ingredients and sauce these tasted like angel hair pasta to me. Worth it! Note the 7 oz package is very small. Really one large meal or 2 smaller meals. Probably only about 1-1/2 cups of noodles.<br /><br />If you are following a low-carb diet these are a treat. More realistic pasta taste than a spaghetti squash, for example. Definitely worth a try.",1

1137,"My daughter (toddler) Is allergic to dairy and soy. We tried goat's milk to no avail and have finally happily settled on Rice Dream Enriched Original. She loves it and Even I like the taste. It's a little sweet and she picked it right up after a year of breastfeeding. With the addition of a multivitamin each day, my pediatrician has approved it's use.<br /><br />We purchase the 64 ounce size for $3.24 at a local store (about $0.05 an ounce.) I came online to look for a better price when purchasing in bulk. The price for these small 8 ounce containers is $0.16 per ounce and causes MUCH more packaging waste. I appreciate the convenience of having it in a small package for dining out, etc... but It's just as easy to take an insulated sippy cup and be more environmentally conscious.<br /><br />The Rice Dream Website sells the 32 ounce size but their price is $0.10 an ounce, without shipping costs. Not much advantage to purchasing online so far. I was hoping that Amazon would have a decent cost on the larger sizes with free super saving shipping, because I could stop shopping at Wal-Mart entirely.<br /><br />I have contacted Amazon to request that they carry the larger 64 ounce size in cases.

1140,"I began using Xylitol as a replacement for sugar about two months ago.  Since then I have not consciously used table sugar in anything I have eaten or drank.  As it was I was only using it for coffee in the morning, and tea in the evenings.  Now I don't use table sugar at all.  Xylitol is as sweet as sugar, and has a vastly different impact on your blood chemistry.  I'll spare you the biochemical details, and suffice to say that if you are on a low-carb lifestyle, Xylitol fits right in.<br />That having been said, make sure you are willing to make a commitment to this product.  Xylitol is not digested, but rather is consumed in part by the bacteria in your stomach.  There is an adjustment period while you build up the suitable level of bacteria (good bacteria, mind you) in your intestines to consume this stuff.  Until that time (and if you go on antibiotics you will experience this again), Xylitol can give you the runs, and gas.  Once you are fully adjusted (takes a couple of weeks), then you will be fine.<br />As to this particular brand of Xylitol, it was very conveniently packaged in single-serving packs (4g) which makes monitoring your intake of this particular stuff very easy.  I have to say that the shipping is very good.  I had the product in hand about 4 days after ordering it.  The retailer has brick-and-mortar locations local to me, but they didn't carry this product there.  I have since ordered again via Amazon, with the same great shipping results.",1

By the third time, I was really looking forward to it in a yummy way and missing it if I didn't have it. I started on it after a friend was treated for breast cancer, and her cancer doctor told her to get and stay on a green superfood. My husband had lung cancer and needed all the help he could get. I researched green superfoods on the Internet, and preferred the contents of this one because it had both fruits and veggies (most have only veggies) with great extras and minimal filler. I bought all the flavors to test, but he didn't like the smell (friends say it smells like wheat grass) and refused to try any of them. My daughter and I tested each and preferred the berry flavor in daily smoothies. The chocolate flavor tastes good, but has less fruit/veggie value. In blender: approx. 1/2 cup of orange juice, 1 banana, squirt of honey, 5 +/- frozen strawberries and Amazing Grass green superfood. Add ice cubes if you like it thicker. It's great! On the cancer subject, I studied cancer survivors and what they attributed to their survival. Result: Consume lots of Flax Seed or Whey, lots of fruits/veggies, remove stress, and remove white sugar and processed foods from the diet. Cancer loves white sugar and fake sugars (Splenda, etc.). The American diet is killing us. Amazing Grass Green Superfood contains flax seed along with lots of natural antioxidant and immunity building fruits and veggies to ward off illness. I used to average two colds per winter. Since taking this (10 months), I can't remember the last time I was sick. My body feels good taking it, and yes, it does keep you regular in a good, natural way as it flushes the toxins out of your system. Just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, my husband refused to do any of the things learned from my studies and he succombed to cancer. I'm staying on the Amazing Grass Green Superfood because I don't want that to happen to me. And because it keeps my body feeling good.",1

They taste somewhat like plastic, and the ""cherry flavor"" is worse than the worst tasting cough medicine you can think of. These don't taste ANYTHING like fruit. These are supposed to be cherry flavored, but the word cherry appears no where in the ingredients (apple puree concentrate is the only fruit item listed), and the word ""fruit"" doesn't appear anywhere at all. They also pull that bait-and-switch telling you 70 calories per serving, but there's 2.5 servings in these dinky little 2.5oz bags. These are disgusting.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

And of the 35 k-cups I received, 25 were 1 of 3 flavors (Green Mountain french vanilla, Mocha Nut Fudge, and Caramel Vanilla Creme). Then there were 1 or 2 of a few other flavors thrown in.<br />I contacted Amazon Customer service, who was very helpful and directed me to the seller directly since Deals for You is a 3rd party seller. They emailed me back and said that they had just changed the ad, that when I ordered (a week prior) the ad didn't specify 25 different flavors (it did, I specifically checked that and ordered because of that promise). They then blamed the issue on Amazon, saying Amazon puts these orders together and they can't control it. So they lied to me, called me a liar, misrepresented their product, and then refused to do anything to make the situation right when it was called to their attention.<br /><br />I have never left a negative review on this site, but after the service I received here, I have left negative reviews for both the seller and product.",1

By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

When you buy from Amazon, though, the beans come from a stack of bags that have been sitting in an Amazon warehouse somewhere. The date code is printed on the bags, and mine was over 6 months old! Anyway, this roaster does make a great product, but I would recommend buying direct from their website. Prices are comparable, so the only downside is you'll have to pay for shipping yourself.",1

I like this product for a fast, tasty gluten free meal- I add coarse ground black pepper and vietnamese hot sauce, sometimes sprinkling chopped tomatoes and/or red peppers on top as a garnish. Of course homemade mac 'n cheese tastes better, but for a night when there's no time to do anything but turn on a burner and wait, this is a great product.

1177,"Here in California, we have an ongoing threat with natural disasters, and I'm thinking specifically of earthquakes. All electricity, natural gas, most communications and transportation could be out of order for unspecified times and It is advised that the populace ought to be prepared for such an event.

Well, no one can ever be totally prepared for a natural disaster, but I try to at least keep the food and drinkable water cabinet full. Fruits and veggies are real easy in canned or dried forms. Nuts, dried foods of other kinds and crackers are a snap. Good sources of protein are another matter and a little more difficult. Here I've gone with a number of canned items and one such item is Kirkland Signature Roast Beef in Beef Broth which comes in four-can packets and which I get at my local Costco warehouse store. It's fairly economical and easy to use. It's rather tasty for a canned meat product and can be eaton as is or cooked into a variety of meals. It's vary low in fat and consists of chunks of top and bottom round. It's fully cooked, but might be heated if you like. Now and then, in non-emergency times, I use a can so that there is a gradual turnover. Plus, I like to take a can or two along  when I go on camping trips.

1179,"Quite literally, I have never seen anything like this gift basket construction from Back Mountain Baskets represented here by the igourmet label. And unfortunately, I don't mean that in a positive way. As someone who frequently purchases gift baskets (I average four to six a year and at one time procured hundreds as corporate gifts), I was extremely dissatisfied with this item. When you purchase a gift basket, two things are relatively certain: 1) you're going to overpay for what's actually included, and (2) at least you're going to get something presentable and of gift quality. Heck, these are even advertised as gourmet items!  Only a couple of items might actually qualify as exotic or gourmet.  At a $49.99 list price, there is maybe $20 worth of small snacks, most of which could be replicated at your local convenience store. If I had made a gift basket at home, it would have been classier and more tasteful than the horribly amateurish efforts made by this company.<br /><br />I won't even discuss the quality of the items included in the basket which I actually have some serious reservations about. This basket is NOT something that you would (or should) pay to have a professional company assemble due to packaging. Many of the included items are stuffed into boxes and wrapped rather cheaply with handmade labels. Okay, not a very deluxe or fancy presentation. But what's worse (and frankly unforgivable) is that the boxes used are not plain white gift boxes or something else presentable--no, they are emptied trash from other products re-purposed.<br /><br />Do you want your elegant food items (again I'm being generous with the item quality) in old cracker boxes glued back together? Just whose recycling bin have they been raiding? It's rather distasteful. Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about--first is the empty box used and in parenthesis is the actual item inside:<br /><br />Keebler Club Cracker Box (pretzels)<br />Stauffer's Animal Cracker Box (other cookies)<br />Crystal Light Fruit Punch Box (candies)<br />Nabisco Wheat Thins Box (popcorn)<br />Jello Gelatin Box (cookies)<br /><br />These are but a few examples of boxes used to repackage other items. I got two of these baskets and they were both constructed in a similar manner. Seriously. If you paid to have an elegant gift basket, would you expect to find loose candies glued into a Crystal Light box? As I said, there isn't even the common sense and taste level to use plain white boxes. It would be an embarrassment to send this as a gift item. Due to the packaging, I even threw a number of items straight into the trash as I was not confident of their handling due to the obvious lack of professional standards. A huge disappointment and very unappetizing all around. KGHarris, 10/11.",1
1180,"One of the ingredients on the label is ""Natural Flavors"" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.  For those who are concerned about their pet's health, I suggest the book ""Natural Health for Dogs and Cats"" by Dr. Richard Pitcairn, D.V.M.",0

1183,"I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.",1

1186,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly.",1

1193,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.

This should be fine if you're making lemon-rose or vanilla-rose or cardamom-rose cream dishes, but you may be disappointed with stand-alone flavor.<br /><br />I prefer the rose extract made by Silver Cloud Estates.

1198,"I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small ""made in Thailand"" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)",1

1201,"The meat in THK dehydrated diets is not raw. It it would not be a human grade food if the meat were actually raw. The manufacturer told me that the meat in their food is ""dehydrated"" at a temperature that actually cooks the meat and that is how it is able to be labeled human grade. If this is the case, why use the word ""Raw"" over and over again in the advertising and ingredient list. It's not raw and it's not as good as raw.<br /><br />Secondly, and perhaps just as important, is that the consumer is paying for things their pet can't digest. The consumer pays for the very expensive dehydration process for VEGETABLES and other things that carnivores cannot digest and do not need. The only way to get the nutrients out of vegetables, fruits and seeds, and into a dog's system is to puree the vegetables and break down the cellulose or to COOK them. From I can tell, neither of these things are done to the vegetables. Ironically, the part of the THK diet that shouldn't be raw is, and the meat, which should be raw, isn't.<br /><br />The fact that a great deal of the honest kitchen diets are not digested is pretty obvious to people who feed it to their dogs. You can clearly see the celery, bananas, and other whole chunks of vegetable/fruit that come out in the stool. If you happen to take a look at the stool after a bit of rain has washed away the smooshy parts, you will see mounds of undigested vegetable matter that seem to equal 80% of the total volume. So not only are you feeding something that isn't being digested, but you are feeding lots of it. Why would you pay for something that is completely wasted?<br /><br />I know several dogs who are or were on THK who presented with hot spots, fleas, allergies, and other chronic conditions that didn't exist when they were on raw diets. I have seen it over, and over again.  After seeing what I've seen, I could never go back to feeding a dehydrated diet from this manufacturer. I do see some promise in the Ziwi Peak line and Stella and Chewy's, so you might want to try those out and stop paying for chunky veggies your dog can't digest.<br /><br />It is far less expensive to feed a raw diet of human grade meats and bone from your grocery store. You would probably pay 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of THK diets. You would even save money if you went with a pre-packaged frozen raw diet such as Primal or Nature's Variety. I know a lot of people feed THK because they are afraid to feed real raw meat, but I pray that will change. THK is making millions, and for that they should be commended. They shed blood, sweat, and tears to create a market for their food and I know that was hard work. But they are/were doing it dishonestly. On top of that, they have the gall to name themselves honest. Yikes.<br /><br />To THK,<br />If you care to tell us exactly what temperatures or radiation your meat is exposed to prior to packaging, and issue a statement that states your finished product contains non-irradiated, raw meat, I'll be happy to edit my review. Since meat begins to undergo chemical changes at 120簞F and litterally cooks at 140簞F, I hope you can supply proof that your product is processed at temperatures below these and is not irradiated.",0
1202,"I was delighted to be able to order these, since local stores no longer carry them.  The bags contain what appear to be chips of pork skin that were parboiled in salt water, then flattened under high pressure.  Be sure to shake them around to distribute them throughout the bag before cooking.  They expand considerably in the bag during 1:00 to 2:00 of nuking, depending on the wattage, etc., but it is a slow expansion, unlike the vigorous popping of corn.  Also, the bag  only expands about half as much as with popcorn.  When ready, these resemble the ones available in cellophane bags that were deep-fried, but these are far tastier, fresher, AND MUCH LOWER IN FAT AND CALORIES.  A whole bag is 210 calories, about 50 calories from fat.  This is less than the low-fat microwave popcorn I use.  One bag, however, has 50% of the daily salt limit for an adult.<br /><br />I especially like these sprinkled with garlic powder and dried marjoram (together).  Other herbs and spices are interesting variations, such as sage or cumin or whatever else might appeal to you.",1
1203,"I have a Keurig coffee maker, which brews a fresh cup of gourmet coffee, tea, or cocoa in less than a minute. If you are not familiar with this machine, it is wonderfully convenient, especially for me, as I only make 1 or two hot beverages at home per day. But I am not reviewing the Keurig coffee maker. I am here to write a glowing review for ""Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.""<br /><br />In the winter hot cocoa is my favorite coffee alternative, and I recently tried Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa K-Cups. Caf&eacute; Escapes Cafe Mocha used to be my favorite brand/blend. However, I now find this Milk Chocolate Cocoa K-Cup absolutely delicious and, by far, the best K-Cup cocoa I have sampled to date. I have tasted 2-3 other brands and flavors, but nothing compares to the full, rich, creamy flavor of this product - much more so than the Cafe Mocha, which is also good but not as creamy.<br /><br />I respectfully disagree with those reviewers who have given Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate Hot Cocoa a poor rating, especially those who didn't care for what they stated was the taste of sucralose, an artificial sweetener. I have a relatively sensitive palate and am usually aware of these artificial flavorings and sugar substitutes. I do not taste these here, nor does my daughter, who also loves hot chocolate....and she is REALLY picky! Of course, this does not taste like the hot chocolate made with whole milk and shaved chocolate - but it is an excellent substitute.<br /><br />It is important to remember to shake the K-Cup before brewing any kind of hot beverage.<br /><br />This product contains milk, soy and tree nuts (highly refined coconut oil). Product is trans-fat and gluten free. Caffeine content is estimated at less than 10 mg per serving (versus 100-150 mg in Arabica coffee).

1207,"When I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!<br /><br />When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.<br /><br />Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.<br /><br />Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.<br /><br />I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:<br /><br />*  French Garden<br />At first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.<br /><br />*  Napa Garden<br />This mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet.",1
1208,"I am a type 2 diabetic and it is under excellent control.  Nevertheless, I'm always looking for ways to give me a hand with it.  I read that Ceylon cinnamon was the 'real' thing so I purchased a pound of it last summer and have been using it.  I did not change anything else in my diet.  Two weeks ago I had my six-month check-up and my 3-month levels were WAY down.  We were all quite surprised and although I do get outside and do more work in the summer, which might help a bit, it has not helped to that degree in years past.  I'm thinking it was the cinnamon, which I use quite a bit in cooking and in the breads I make (I make all our own).  Yes, it's got a great taste, but I'm afraid I'm not much of a gourmet when it comes to cinnamon -- I like it in whatever form it comes in!  I am thinking, though, that there really is something to the claims being made for this stuff in terms of blood sugar control.  I'm ordering more now.",1

1210,"If you liked this tea, you back to drinking your coffee. Obviously you don't know what tea is about.<br /><br />This tea has very strong aroma when you first open it. However this aroma is not of natural origin, the added chemical scent destroyed the original smell. Giving this tea bag a few dips in 80 degree c hot water (which is how hot the water should be at) this tea is low grade at best. It does not give a soothing taste after you drink it rather it leaves bitter taste all over. Also, for people who like strong tea tastes, this tea bag has nothing of that. Granted it is black tea, but black tea being roasted the longest out of tea leaves should have a strong taste.<br /><br />Those 5 star raters need to have their tongues checked. If you liked those tea sampled at Teavana, you got problems.",0
1211,"This is an amazing nostalgic trip to the candy store of years past. The box contains a dizzying array of candy that was popular in the 1960s. Many of these candies have been rarely to never seen in the years since. Some can't pass contemporary political muster (candy cigarettes or licorice pipes, anyone?) and some were novelties even at the time (wax lips, for instance) and don't taste any better now than they did then. Sadly many of the candies are now made overseas (the candy cigarettes were made, much to my surprise, in Macedonia), but they do look and taste authentic and are packaged nicely in a sturdy box with a bow on it.<br /><br />One of my favorites in the box is the ""Big Hunk"" candy bar which I remember dimly at best. Although the directions for preparing and eating the ""Big Hunk"" on the back are certainly modern (and involve either flinging your ""Big Hunk"" as hard as you can or microwaving it), they are very funny nonetheless. I really love the ""Lemon Heads"" and ""Cherry Heads"" and I don't think I had seen cinnamon toothpicks for decades, but the real treat in the box for me was the little bag of ""Gold Mine Gum"" which is still as cool (and tasty) as it was years ago.<br /><br />This is an expensive box of candy, and is probably not something you would buy every day. Having said that, you get about two and a half pounds of great retro candy presented nicely in a box for your money. I highly recommend this to anyone who misses the strange and wonderful candies of the 1960s.",1

I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads.

1214,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.

1215,"Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Amazon page.<br /><br />Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all.",0

1217,"For all the hype these Leonard Mountain dry soups have gotten, they sure did disappoint. I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. (""edible"" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it ""gourmet"" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies ""chunky"" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself ""gourmet"" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a ""real"" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",0
1221,"Let me start by saying I love Lavazza coffee.  I generally get the Crema e Gusto or the Qualita Rossa and I find them both incredibly delicious coffees.  I thought I'd expand my Lavazza palate a bit and try the Tierra and so I confidently ordered the 3 can pack, but as I'm beginning can #2, I'm finding myself simply waiting out the use of cans 2 and 3 so I can go back to my regular Crema.<br /><br />The Tierra is not bad coffee - not by a long shot. It's smooth and... the word I keep thinking of is ""light"", especially if you're used to drinking a darker, richer roast.  It has that slight lemon aftertaste on my tongue that Columbian coffee has, and I don't like that at all so I add flavored creamer to disguise that after taste rather than my normal warmed regular cream . And once the flavored creamer is added, it disguises the good as well as the bad flavors so I'm left feeling like I'm missing out on the coffeeness of my coffee.  Also, I find myself using nearly twice as much ground coffee to make a pot as I use of the Crema or Qualita Rossa, so the cans themselves will only last half as long.<br /><br />Having said all that, I'm giving it four stars because my parents are visiting and this morning I made them the Tierra for breakfast and they really loved it.  They both prefer a lighter roast and usually cream the heck out of their coffee at my house to dilute it down a bit.  The Tierra they found delicious.  So I'm giving it 4 stars to differentiate it from my favorite Lavazzas (which are 5s!) but also to acknowledge that this is probably really good coffee for those who enjoy a lighter roast.",1

While ""quercetin"" is widely recognized as an effective blood toner, conditioner, and ""bad"" cholesterol reducer, FRS is prominently promoting it as an energizer, capable of ""extending"" the body's natural adrenaline ""and"" removing the ""oxidants that cause fatigue.""  A controversial statement, backed by little controlled studies, especially if the inference is that quercetin will provide an immediate ""lift.""<br /><br />Of course, FRS points out that it's not simply the individual ingredients that provide increased energy but an optimal, catalytic combination that promotes thermogenesis, increases metabolic rate, and helps the body make efficient use of carbohydrates.  So it's possible the product has worked for many (besides Mr. Armstrong).  If so, testimonials on its behalf deserve to be taken seriously by any curious, health-minded individuals.<br /><br />The powdered drink mix perhaps makes the most sense to start with, and the chewy bites the least (the sugar in the bites actually had a paradoxical effect, momentarily enervating rather than energizing me).  The drink is flavorable enough, with a convincing fresh-fruitish ""tang,"" and not overly sweet.  But in my case it did not counteract either the late-morning or late-afternoon ""crashes"" and obviate the need for that extra expresso or two.<br /><br />If you choose to try the product, be exceptionally careful about the apparently generous internet offer, endorsed by Mr. Armstrong, of a complete sample kit of the products sent free of charge (with the exception of postage and handling costs).  The merchandising tactics of FRS are practically antithetical to the full-disclosure, consumer-centric policies of a site like Amazon.  (If Bezos offered everyone a free Kindle, saying it's yours to keep if you don't like it, I'd have full confidence in his offer; FRS employs more deceptive, misleading tactics that could result in your admittance to a pricey club before you even realized you were a member.)<br /><br />So put Lance Armstrong and his company (he's part owner) to the test, but order the products through Amazon to avoid unwanted hassle, hustle and hype.  If you decide the product is for you, then is the time to inquire into the benefits of being a member of the club.",1

I also bring a bunch with me when I am travelling so I don't have to eat junk food on airplanes etc. These are so filling and so large compared to other bars. I love that they are also gluten-free. They do taste like a candy bar - that's the best part! I don't feel like I am dieting. This is my favorite flavor, although I also eat the Brownie Crunch to mix it up. You will not be disappointed!

1226,"Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.<br /><br />There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. ""And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit."" (1 Nephi 8:12)<br /><br />If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.<br /><br />After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!",1

1229,"We lost our first cat to stomach cancer when she was only 6 years old.  When we adopted our two new cats, I did a lot of research on nutrition.  I found that the grocery store brand dry food we fed our first cat was full of unnecessary carbs and fillers like corn and wheat.  Cats don't need carbs in their diet, because in the wild they would be eating live prey, and the prey's stomach contents would be the only grains the cat would get.  Keeping that in mind, I became an avid label reader.  I now feed my cats 1 can of Innova EVO or similar quality food each day, plus 1/2 cup of Innova EVO dry kibble.  If I had the time and the local resources to feed a raw diet, I would.  But Innova EVO, in combination with other super premium foods and the occasional treat of raw chicken meat, bones and organs, gives my guys super shiny coats and lots of energy.  The litter box is also not as stinky since they absorb many more nutrients.  I now have two healthy one-year-old cats who look forward to meal times and don't have any health problems.

1234,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health.",0
1235,"This thing is HUGE and my Great Dane absolutely adores it! I purchased 2 chews, a knotted one and this braided one, and I must say that I am very happy. That's saying a lot because I usually hate rawhide -- my dog normally devours most rawhide treats in about 15 minutes and during that time manages to tear off at least one soft wet chunk big enough to choke on and scare the daylights out of me. These are designed in a way those scary moments haven't happened!<br />These chews are truly CHUNKY - the ring is easily over 8 inches diameter and the braid is about 3 inches across, the rawhide is super thick and the whole thing is HEAVY. The braided design makes it so he cannot pull large pieces off to choke on and he has to work very hard to get even small pieces off. Normally if he has to work hard at a chew he will just give up - but not these! He carries it all over the house, plays with it by throwing it in the air (which is very loud on my wood floor), and then settles down for some chewing time -- this chew keeps him entertained for a good hour or more. In this hour of chewing he does NOT devour the rawhide like many other brands we have tried, he just barely manages to get a small 4 inch section gnawed soft then gets tired and takes a nap.  In 3 days he has not gotten bored with this routine and we still have 98% of the original chew left! To me - that is a cost effective chew toy! He seems to prefer this braided ring over the knotted type - maybe because the circle design enables him to hold the chew firmly with his paws (see picture) or maybe because of the tasty beef basting. Even more impressive is that the basting looks to be thoroughly embedded into and throughout all of the rawhide not just brushed on the outside; it does not come off on his white legs or my beige carpet - how WONDERFUL is that?!<br />I feel it is important to note that these are all-natural rawhide chews MADE IN THE USA (Illinois). They do say ""a product of Brazil"" on the outside of the package because they are made from free range, natural grass-fed BRAZILIAN beef hides (without chemicals, preservatives or bleaches). They are also antibiotic, hormone and preservative free. All of their rawhide products are lot-coded for traceability back to the cow. They are a PetAg product (a USA company founded in 1930) which is a division of Borden (another USA company).<br /><br />So in closing: They might seem a bit expensive at first glance, but I have discovered they are high quality, long lasting, and dog entertaining... that to me is worth every penny and if my dog ever makes it through the 2 chews I we already have -- I will happily purchase more!",1
1236,"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job.

1242,"I've had this for a few weeks, and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />The hugest advantage to this system is the urine is separated from the 'litter' and odor is greatly reduced.  The litter consist of pellets similar in shape/size to the wood-based natural litters, but they are of a hard clay, which doesn't break down with moisture, and they keep their shape.  Thus, the urine drains straight down through a grid to the pad (in its own slide-out drawer), and the poo stays on top to be scooped away.<br /><br />The pee will not ferment with the characteristic stench, and you don't have to deal with clumping litter which doesn't really clump, and is just plain stinky and messy to scoop up.<br /><br />The proprietary 'pee' pads are kind of like a giant maxi pad, and absorb a lot of liquid.  Also, the bottom side of the pad is plastic, and the pad fits into the tray in a way that the plastic is upturned to keep the tray itself dry. Maintenance consists of merely taking the drawer out to the trash, and sliding the pad out, putting in a new one, and sliding the drawer back into the bottom of the box.<br /><br />The litter itself are hard pellets, which hardly get tracked, and it is 100% dustless.  A pellet or two stick to paws, but are easily picked up and tossed back into the box.  Scooping is easy, and if the poo is dry, you can kind of shake it around in the scoop to knock off some of the pellets, then throw it in the trash instead of wasting water with a toilet flush.<br /><br />It takes mere seconds to maintain the box vs. 10 minutes of scooping and scraping soggy clumping litter which doesn't really clump, but falls apart.<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter (once a month), it just pours into the trash, no scraping the soggy wet concrete of old.<br /><br />Some say you get a 'poo' smell, since kitties can't bury it quite like they did with the old type of litter, but I'll take that over the overpowering stench of fermented urine any day.  And, the smell goes away quite shortly, just like human smell in the bathroom.  Note that you should just use one bag of the pellets in the box, the litter won't be as deep.  I just give the box a quick shake daily to even it back out.<br /><br />Cat adaption to the new box:  This won't work for everyone, but this is what I did:  I set up the new Breeze system next to the old box (which was fairly gross, as I let it get bad) to see what would happen.  I placed a clump of the old litter into the new box to let him know it was 'his.'  My 9 year old fellow was pretty much using the new box right away (probably out of curiousity more than anything).  After 3 days or so, I removed the old box and inserted it directly into the garbage, never to be dealt with again.  No problems, 100% compliance on Max's part.<br /><br />If Tidy Cats came out with a fully hooded version of the box, it would be great for the folks who have standing pee-ers, but my fellow doesn't do that, so I'm lucky.<br /><br />Finally, some say the pellets and pads are expensive, but I estimate the cost as about equal to the old style of box over the long run - and the convenience and ease of maintenance should erase any other doubt.<br /><br />Also, this system has the potential of keeping tons of conventional clay litter out of landfills.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",1
1243,"Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.",1

And despite the name, it's not at all salty; low-sodium versions are available, which means bacon lovers (even vegetarians) can satisfy their yearnings without the health risks associated with heavy animal fats.<br /><br />BTW, one thing we especially appreciate about Bacon Salt's makers (two high-tech guys who, over a meal, confessed that they'd always wished everything could taste like bacon, then funded their venture with $10K won on ""America's Funniest Home Videos"") is their ""Operation Bacon Salt,"" in which orders shipped from the company to APO addresses sell for half-price. It's refreshing to find a firm that will not only ship to APO addresses (not all do), but will actually do something generous for our men and women who serve in the military. It's a cool (and legal) way, too, to get that lovely, bacony flavor to military personnel who serve in countries where bacon and other pork products are not permitted.<br /><br />Try all the flavors. And try the yummy Baconnaise, too; it comes in regular and ""lite"" versions, and lets you make a low-calorie, low-sodium, zero cholesterol BLT that will just about make any bacon-lover's day. It's also wonderful on a baked potato.<br /><br />We have no commercial interest in the company, and do (and will continue to do) most of our shopping on Amazon. We're just big fans of Bacon Salt products, happy to see their products available here.",1

1251,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.",1

1258,"It seems hard to find great muesli these days. I think this is one of the better ones, and I do buy it. However, I wish those making muesli would heed the latest nutritional advice. For example, nutritionists say that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is important and that we generally get too much of the omega-6 fatty acids and not enough of the omega-3's. This muesli would be a lot more nutritious if it replaced the large amount of sunflower seeds (high in omega-6 fatty acids) with walnuts (high in omega-3 fatty acids) and almonds. And to me that would make it taste better too. I also wish they would make a version without all the raisins and dates, allowing one to add fresh fruit (e.g., raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, etc.) instead of dried fruit.<br /><br />I was in Australia last spring and found great muesli there not only meeting these nutritional criteria but tasting better than this or most other muesli. To me nuts are an important part of good muesli. But I'm being a bit of a purist, I know, and a friend tells me I'm a food snob, so take my opinion with that in mind!",1

1263,"***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW"">Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn't realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted ""real"" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0"">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn't even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap.",1

1265,"I was really glad to receive this case of cans of black beans from Amazon, because the cold winter is starting out here in the desert, especially over night, and I thought it would be great to have some warm black beans for lunch at work.<br /><br />So far this warm year I have been eating for lunch cold <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZU7QQ"">Eden Organic Garbanzo Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> mixed with Mori-Nu Silken Extra Firm Tofu, 24 pack and other stuff at hand, but the cold nights and days make me want something warm instead.<br /><br />When I lived in Guatemala back a quarter century ago, we had black beans and tortilla, hand made, so this sounded really nice. As soon as the case came, I got out a can at night to simmer with diced onion, garlic and a few cumin seeds, to warm to work the next day.<br /><br />Round midnight, I got up to check the beans, still warming,and smelling great. I decided to try half a spoonful to see if they were all right. They smelled way too fresh. One half spoonful led to another, and soon the whole pot was gone.<br /><br />They were THAT good!<br /><br />So anyway, next day I had the usual garbanzo and tofu salad, with fresh lemon juice, and will go now to see if I get some black beans ready for lunch tomorrow!<br /><br />They really are great: good texture, very fresh, and the taste very fresh. After using this brand name for so long, I can trust its uniformity, with no surprises from batch to batch, all of the highest quality. I know some people might say, dude, it's black beans, bake your own, dried from a bag! But the freshness of these apparently never dried beans is something ""to die for!"" or rather, to live for . . .<br /><br />Great beans. Won't let you down.

That's not even mentioning that it has soybean products in it.  Soybeans (except for the fermented forms like tempah) elevate one's estrogen levels which can increase the chance of cancer risks...especially estrogen mediated breast cancers.  And it has Autolyzed Yeast Extract which is another name for the infamous neurotoxin....MSG (monosodium glutamate). I don't understand why this well known company has to use dangerous ingredients when there are so many substitutes that will not destroy our populations health.  Is it purely because it's so much cheaper to use these dangerous, life threatening products that they only see their profit margins and not the health of the nation.  As much as I love the flavor of this soup mix, I can not recommend it to anyone!  I will not be ordering this health 'time bomb' ever again.  Eat it at your own risk!!!",0

1271,"I've been drinking this brand [OG] for over 12 months now, and believe that Organo Gold coffee is different from alot of the 'healthy' coffee brands and 'regular' brands out there. ""OG"" as I like to call it, is 100% Arabica [low acidity] and has only 9mg of caffeine per cup, as opposed to the 134mg in 'regular' coffee. At first I was worried that I'd get headaches and / or some other type of 'withdrawal' symptoms from the decreased amount of caffeine, but the Ganoderma in this coffee more than compensates for that. It naturally invigorates a body, and overall, one should feel very calm. Most people mention to me that this coffee tastes 'very good' and 'smooth'. Most comment on the noticeable energy and stamina that day after just one cup. Some have lost weight and most experience detoxification within one week. If you have health issues or ailments, you may want to search-engine 'ganoderma (comma) 'any disease' you can think of, to find out more. You will find many brands of 'healthy coffee' out there-in my opinion this one tastes really good. But I highly recommend you taste the product and see what it can do for YOU. Every 'body' is different.  I'm just one person, but for me, this brand has positively affected my: blood pressure, sugar cravings, mood, flexibility, migraines/headaches, skin, allergies [prone to sinus allergies]. I am happy to report that I have NEVER encountered: jitters, crash, burning stomach, nor nausea with this coffee (as was the case with my previous habit of 3 to 4 cups a day of 'regular' coffee).

1272,"I agree 100% with ""nuttinbutdtruth""--this coffee is great and, thankfully, does not have the Starbucks ""burnt"" flavor which comes from roasting the beans to a higher internal bean temperature (i.e., burning them).  The Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is smooth with a real coffee flavor.  I have also bought Eight O' Clock Original coffee, and it tastes similar to the Colombian--both are great tasting and apparently are American Roast (""American Roast is a light to medium roast...This roast results in a full bodied, acidic cup of coffee."").<br /><br />Starbucks coffee, on the other hand, tastes to me like French Roast (""French roast is similar to Espresso roast only a little bit darker. This roasting style produces a full bodied coffee that has low acidity and a dominating bittersweet flavor."") or maybe Italian Roast (""Italian roasted coffee beans are nearly completely black in color. This roasting style produces a coffee that is very weak bodied with strong burnt flavors and low acidity."").  Each to their own, but according to many coffee experts, ""...acidity is a good thing when it comes to coffee"", and as stated on one coffee website: ""In actuality the medium roast better preserves the true coffee bean as the darker roasts burn off some of the natural coffee oils and cause it to have a harsher taste. The medium roasts allow you to better savoir the way the coffee bean was intended to taste.""  Also, according to the same website: ""A darker roast can actually make a lower quality coffee bean taste better. The bean no longer relies on the flavors from its origin and leans more on the burnt flavor that results from the darker roasting process.""<br /><br />According to another coffee website: ""Maximum aroma and flavor, is generally found at the lighter end of the dark range. At the darkest end of the dark range, coffee has lost all of its acidity and has a distinctly burnt flavor.""  And according to Wikipedia: ""At lighter roasts, the bean will exhibit more of its 'origin flavor'; the flavors created in the bean by the soil and weather conditions in the location where it was grown. Coffee beans from famous regions like Java, Kenya, Hawaiian Kona, and Jamaican Blue Mountain are usually roasted lightly so their signature characteristics dominate the flavor. As the beans darken to a deep brown, the origin flavors of the bean are eclipsed by the flavors created by the roasting process itself. At darker roasts, the 'roast flavor' is so dominant that it can be difficult to distinguish the origin of the beans used in the roast.""<br /><br />As a fan of American Roast coffee with a truer coffee bean flavor, I think this Eight O' Clock 100% Colombian coffee is extremely hard to beat.  It is also reasonably priced.",1

1296,"It really stinks that eating the healthiest foods costs the most but in my opinion, it's worth it.  I love these cereals.  The first case I bought from amazon was the original and I wound up eating it for breakfast, snacks, lunch, whenever, without milk or adding anything... I love the crunch and the taste. I actually ate the whole case in about 2 weeks and very little else... and it is amazing that I didn't gain weight, my bms were much better, and I had great energy and felt well- my body was craving it.  Try that on Coco Puffs, Cornflakes, and even any of the other ""healthy"" cereals in the healthfood stores!<br /><br />I actually make my own sprouted grain breads and crackers which I could easily break up to make this type of cereal- there is nothing in the world like it, but it takes 2 days of sprouting and a couple of hours to complete the food processing and spreading on the baking sheet process, and then 3-4 hours of low-heat baking.  So when I don't have time to do this, a very close second are the Ezekiel products (their bread, english muffins, cereals, and pastas).<br /><br />Anyone who makes health their top priority will eat very little of non-sprouted grain products (flour products).  For those interested, Amazon sells a book called the Essene Gospel of Peace which contains writings found in the Vatican archives- in this little book, Jesus teaches his followers how to make bread, and it has nothing to do with taking the dry grain and grinding it up into flour and using yeast- he teaches them to soak the grain, let the sun bring it to life, grind it up alive, and then let the sun bake it.  That makes the only truly living, healthful breads and cereals.<br /><br />Yes, these products will feel and taste different than most are used to, but the more one eats this type of real food, the more the body starts remembering and then one begins to really enjoy the taste and textures because they equate to life and health.  :)",1

1298,"When I was a kid, I used to buy boxes full of bubble gum balls and chew them while poring over my latest haul of Marvel and DC comic books.  Other gums have come and gone since then, but these days Dubble Bubble is my favorite gumball - although now I chew them while looking at a computer screen.<br /><br />Awhile back I discovered that a local department store chain stocked 20-ounce milk carton-style packages of Dubble Bubble.  I immediately began buying them for work so I could freshen my breath in an enjoyable fashion after drinking coffee or eating lunch.  Soon, one of my coworkers got addicted to them as well.  So we worked out a deal.  He buys the donuts, and I buy the Dubble Bubble.  Nice.<br /><br />As for the taste - well, back in the day I used to eat them by color, and my favorites were the red (Cherry) and pink (Strawberry).  But now I just take whatever spills out of the carton because they're all good to me.  Yeah, the flavor goes away fairly quickly, and I wish it lasted longer.  However, it's a good excuse to pop in a couple more balls.<br /><br />And what about blowing bubbles, you might ask?  Well, I've never come close to the massive bubbles I used to create with Bubblicious.  I just blew one the size of an orange with a ten-ball wad of Dubble Bubble, so perhaps greater feats of bubble creation are possible.  At least now I don't have to worry about getting gum gnarled in my hair - one of the perks of male pattern baldness, I suppose.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble gumballs are a great pick-me-up, and they smell better on my breath than stale coffee.  Of course, they aren't the healthiest snack around due to the corn syrup flavoring.  But then again, life is 100% fatal, and it's usually the little things - like bubble gum and comic books - that smooth over the rough spots and make it fun.",1

Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging.

1306,"Years ago Philips and Douwe Egberts were partners in the development of the machine and coffee pods.  The copyright on the pod system was ruled invalid and a decision was made to offer the pods via on line vendors only; no more brick and mortar stores.  Philips then sold their share of the coffee business to Douwe Egberts and are moving pod production to Brazil.  This is causing the delay, especially with the Dark Roast.  According to Senseo the coffee should be by June or July at the latest.  Or so they say.  I am surprised that they have not made this info more available.  Seems like many will simply move on to another coffee machine.  Meanwhile try using a regular coffee filter and espresso grind your own coffee.  I've tried Starbucks coffee and not bad.  Less creama, but good flavor.  Google 'make your own coffee pods' to see the methods used to trim the filter and pack the coffee.

1312,"(update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.""<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from ""soaking the flesh of the older coconut"". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)",0
1313,"I bought this cereal after reading all the reviews on here about how great it is as a GF version of Cheerios. Cheerios were a staple in my house before I was diagnosed with CD. While Whole O's are good, the similarities between the two stop at shape. When I had my first bowl, it was a strange feeling because my eyes thought I was eating Cheerios, but i was tasting corn flakes. Whole O's are made from corn and rice, while Cheerios are more oat-based. The Whole O's are, in my opinion, exactly like Nature's Path's corn flakes, except a different shape.<br /><br />Whole O's are pretty high in fiber and low in sugar, taste fine and hold milk well.

1316,"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed.",1

I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!",1

I have mixed my own using Bette Hagman's recipes, and I've used Bob's, Arrowhead Mills, and Pamela's multipurpose blends...this is the only one that produces the feel (aka, 'crumb') of 'normal' foods. I have found that I do not like the taste of bean flour, and this Authentic Foods blend is free of bean. I have a buttermilk pancake recipe that I use this in; they come out so delicious that even if I could eat wheat, I would keep making them with this flour. Love this stuff, and I love not having to keep 10 bags of individual flours in my fridge. I won't be without it!",1
1328,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",0
1329,"I have been drinking French Roast coffee for over 20 years.  I was a little unsure about ordering 5lbs of coffee without trying it.  I was concerned about people who commented that it was not a true French Roast - well it is!<br />Occasionally I drink Vienna roast which is the lightest of the dark roasts - not as dark as French.  I don't like the burnt smokey taste of Italian roast.  So it's French roast for me.<br />I knew this coffee was good just by the slight aroma without even opening the bag.  The beans are the right color for a French Roast and slightly oily, as should be.<br />I boil the water and use a filter cone to make the coffee.  This coffee is rich just like a French Roast should be.  This is the French Roast for me from now on.<br /><br />May 2012(Follow-up review.  My third bag was a lighter roast - more like a Vienna roast - but still very good quality.",1
1330,"Over the last 3 years I have sampled every major protein bar offering and I have to say these Power Crunch bars are my favorite.  It has a very sugary, chocolate taste that is similar to real chocolate wafer cookies. Power Crunch does not have the thick, hard protein ""paste"" you'll find in most bars. The chocolate wafer style is soft and almost disintegrates in your mouth - quite a contrast from most protein bar offerings. I've eaten probably a dozen a week for the last six weeks and I still cannot get enough of these bars.<br /><br />In all fairness most protein bars have 30+ grams of protein - more than double the amount than the 14 grams in Power Crunch. So personally I consider Power Crunch to be a very healthy high protein candy bar rather than protein bar. But after tasting Power Crunch, it'll be a long time before I reach for another Detour, MET-Rx, Oh Yeah, South Beach, or any other bar.",1
1331,"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.",1
1332,"I have tried 10 different brands of flaxseed meal and can tell you that this is by far the best tasting and has the most consistent quality. There are two types of flaxseeds, brown and golden. Both have the same nutritional value, but golden flaxseed is significantly smoother in taste and not as pungent/bitter aftertaste.  I especially like Bob's Red mill for the organic offerings at a minimal price increase. I regularly sprinkle 1-2 tablespoons on my cereal in the morning to give it a nutritional punch of fiber, protein and essential fatty acids. The texture is very fine and almost has no noticeable effect on the cereal, if I went with 1 Tbls, you wouldn't even know it was there. I highly recommend giving Bob's products a try, I am sure you will find it as enjoyable as I have. Always store flaxseed meal refrigerated, opened or not.",1
1333,"Long time Oatmeal eater here.  I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey.  Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!",1

My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch.

1339,"I have been a doctor for 50 years. In that time there are now probably 1000 times as many medications and 500 times more medical procedures. Every one of them in order to be accepted has to undergo what is called a double blinded, placebo controlled study. An appropriate number of patients have to be recruited. In the case of Lipitor it was 10,000. 5000 took Lipitor and 5000 took the placebo, which looked exactly like the Lipitor pill. None of the patients or nurses or doctors knew who got what. All of the patients were seen often and after 5 years Pfizer broke the code and discovered that the Lipitor treated group had 50% less heart attacks, strokes and death. Every pill and every procedure has to be tested this way if it is to get on the market. FRS has never been tested this way and never will. The beneficial effects of this product depend on the placebo effect. If you believe something will benefit you because you have read many + testimonials there is a very good chance you will experience a benefit. Of course drinking a potion and expecting to, and then feeling better is a piece of cake compared to the potion actually curing cancer or healing an ulcer.

1340,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.",0
1341,"I have five dogs and have been feeding both the medium and large sizes of this product for several months.  I have no doubt that it cleans their teeth.  However, I have two problems with this product.  One is with the sizing.  In the large size, there are always plenty of chews that should be considered medium.  Since I pay extra for the large size, I expect that they should all be large.  Also, there are often ones included that are way too thick, and can't be chewed in a reasonable time.<br />The other problem is with my old black lab mix, Fargo.  He chews for awhile and then proceeds to swallow the whole thing.  Invariably, it gets caught in his throat and I have to fish it out.  He resents this as he believes I am trying to steal it.  I have discontinued using these and am looking for another product that works equally well but is less apt to be swallowed whole.",1

1344,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

The toy in the base intrigued them but unfortunately it's not a furry mouse as shown in the picture, but instead is (was) just a paper pom-pom.  Our smallest kitty had the toy in shreds by the end of the second day.  The base of the Kong scratcher is cardboard and the unit moves at the slightest touch, so you need to add extra weight in order to use it.  We bought the Bergan Turbo Cat Scratcher at the same time, and I'd recommend it over the Kong.  The Bergan model has a similar scratching mat and a heavy plastic base that stays in place.  And our kitties love pushing the ball around the track on the Bergan.  Overall, at around $12.00, the Bergan is more expensive but promises to last much longer.<br /><br />Update on 9/07/10:  Be aware that the refills that Amazon sells to accompany this Kong cat scratcher are too big for the base.  The only way to use them is to cut them down, which is a pretty messy process.  Meanwhile, our Bergan is still going strong.  (Their refills do fit their base.)",1

It has excellent flavor, is genuine sea salt, and you use less sea salt than regular salt when seasoning food because it is a stronger flavor.

1354,"I used this gelatin to make marshmallows. When it was hot it smelled VERY bad. I called the company and they said, ""the beef gelatin has always smelled more than the pork."" The marshmallows came out very good, but the smell was so bad I remember it and it turned my stomach. It does not smell in the package at room temperature.<br /><br />Addition: After wondering why boiled cartilage would smell so bad, I looked at the FDA website. The production of gelatin seems to be completely un-inspected. The FDA has no jurisdiction over post food production items like this. The FDA says that this industry uses dropped cows and other items designated as not suitable for food.<br /><br />From the FDA:<br /><br />""Domestically, generally human food that<br />contains meat only in a relatively small proportion or that<br />historically has not been considered by consumers to be products of the<br />meat food industry (e.g., soup stock, beef flavors and extracts,<br />gelatin), is not produced under USDA inspection (see definition of<br />``meat food product'' in 21 U.S.C. 601(j)) and may be physically<br />available for use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics. Further,<br />even when excluded from human food produced in USDA-inspected<br />establishments, prohibited cattle materials may leave the<br />establishments for inedible rendering or destruction. These materials,<br />which previously have not been explicitly prohibited in human food and<br />cosmetics by FDA, might then be used in FDA-regulated human food or<br />cosmetics. For example, prohibited cattle materials leaving a USDA-<br />inspected facility might not be denatured sufficiently to preclude<br />their use in FDA-regulated human food and cosmetics.<br />  Under the Food Safety and Inspection Services' (FSIS') rule, SRMs,<br />small intestine from all cattle, and material from nonambulatory<br />disabled cattle must be designated as inedible. However, certain<br />products, such as gelatin and collagen (which are both covered by the<br />provisions of this rule) used in FDA-regulated human food and<br />cosmetics, have traditionally been produced from cattle material deemed<br />inedible by the USDA. Therefore, such a designation by the USDA may not<br />be enough to preclude use of prohibited cattle materials in FDA-<br />regulated products without additional regulation by FDA. Further, some<br />cattle are not slaughtered under continuous USDA inspection (e.g., some<br />are sent directly to rendering). Cattle material from these animals,<br />such as brains or bones which include SRMs, could end up as starting<br />material for human food, such as meat extracts or gelatin,<br />respectively. Furthermore, if prohibited cattle materials were used in<br />FDA-regulated human food or cosmetics, the rule would facilitate FDA's<br />ability to use the enforcement mechanisms of the Federal Food, Drug,<br />and Cosmetic Act (the act) that apply to adulterated products (e.g.,<br />seizure) to prevent human exposure to the prohibited cattle materials.""<br />Federal Register - 69FR 42255 July 14, 2004: Interim Final Rule -- Use of Materials Derived From Cattle in Human Food and Cosmetics<br /><br />[...]",0

Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating.""",0

By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food.

1364,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.",1

Dark Roasts break down the sugar and oils and burn the coffee bean to a crisp and you are left with ash material.

It only took one cup in the morning to affect my overall health.<br /><br />So as much as I enjoy this super dark roasted coffee, I must make the switch to the light roast.

Lavazza coffee<br />2. Made using 100% Arabica coffee beans<br />3. Blended from 100% Arabica beans.<br />4. Blended to make espresso<br />5. Roasted and Packaged in Italy.<br /><br />Differences:<br />The Lavazza Gold can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from two countries:<br />1. Central America and,<br />2. Africa.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the Central American beans in this blend contributes a floral aroma.<br /><br />The Lavazza Black can coffee uses 100% Arabica beans from only one country:<br />1. South America.<br />Note: Lavazza states that the South American beans in this blend are sweet and aromatic.<br /><br />Opinion:  Both coffees are excellent.  They have different characteristics and while everyone pretty much agrees that both are excellent coffees, some will favor the Black Can variety over the Gold Can - and vice-versa.  NEITHER are bad coffees, they just appeal to different tastes and one might perform better in your coffee making procedure/equipment than the other.  That still doesn't make either one ""bad"", it just makes one variety better suited to a particular brewing procedure and to personal taste.<br /><br />I prefer one variety to the other MOST of the time - primarily because of the excellent result/taste I get from one using my primary coffee making procedure.  When I use a completely different system AND procedure for making coffee, I prefer the other variety.  BOTH are excellent coffees but one is more likely to perform better in your coffee making method and system and give you better results than the other.

1409,"This is my favorite coconut oil for eating and moisturizing both.  It is unrefined virgin coconut oil and has that great coconut smell (and taste!).  If you want odorless / tasteless coconut oil - make sure you purchase the REFINED coconut oil.<br /><br />Coconut oil has never made me nauseous and this one is no different - it's one of the best, highest quality oils I've ever had and I highly recommend from everything from cooking (does not degrade at high heat like olive oil) to moisturizing (coconut glow and super shiny hair!).<br /><br />Bought a smaller size initially and went through it in no time flat.

1411,"I have been giving Wellness to my 7 month old pitbull since he was 8 weeks old. I chose it because it is supposed to be a good and natural food. It's very expensive and I thought I was giving my puppy the best. Wrong.<br />My pup has had bad gas all this time but I did not think it was due to the dog food. We just thought he was eating too fast. Then when he was 4 months, he got very sick.. throwing up and loose stools. We took him to the vet for x-rays just to be sure there was no obstruction. There was not. He got better but the gas continued.<br />About 2 weeks ago, my dog started vomiting his Wellness food a few hours after eating. It looked whole. He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- ""Wellness Super5mix sick"" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product!

1413,"Do you know Kimchi? This is the most popular food in Korea and is a renowned traditional Korean food throughout the world. Most Chinese enjoy eating this, and one of my American friends likes Kimchi. There is this in every store, and you can even find it in Wal-mart and Kessler's in Aberdeen. I would like to talk about Kimchi, and then recommend you to eat Kimchi.<br />What is Kimchi? Kimchi is Korean, a spicy pickled or fermented mixture containing cabbage, onions, and sometimes fish, variously seasoned, as with garlic, horseradish, red peppers, and ginger, according to http://www.dictionary.com. Actually there are lots of types of Kimchi in Korea, but the Kimchi that we talk about in daily life is `Baechu Kimchi', and its main vegetable is a white cabbage which gives out a special flavor. What makes it smell special is that it is not only fermented food, but also made of different vegetables that have unique flavors respectively with special Korean seasonings, including garlic, hot pepper and onion. Due to these reasons, Kimchi is loved by Asians, while it is not loved by Americans and Europeans.<br /> I have several reasons why I like Kimchi; first, I like spicy food, such as hot pickles. When making Kimchi, a lot of Korean traditional hot pepper is used, and this gets Kimchi to taste very spicy. In my case, I have trouble in the process of digestion, but Kimchi contains lots of fiber that helps my intestine clean, and it promotes the secretion of an enzyme needed to break down the protein.<br />Except these benefits, Kimchi has important efficacies. It has antimicrobial action as it is getting fermented; lactic acid bacteria generated during fermentation control growth of other harmful bacteria. It not only prevents adult diseases such as heart attack, hyperpiesia, obesity and diabetes, but also gives abundant vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B, vitamin C, calcium, iron, etc.<br /> If you are looking for something good for your health, why don't you try Kimchi? It keeps you healthy, as well as tastes fantastic, moreover, capsaicin, which makes spicy flavor in hot pepper, helps you lose weight. If you are worried about the spicy flavor of Kimchi, don't worry about that! A few years ago, non-spicy Kimchi was developed for you and is on sale now. It is necessary to eat Kimchi to the west people who live on bread and meat because another ingredient in Kimchi makes meat and bread soft and smooth. And finally it helps people digest well.<br /> Nowadays, as developing technologies of transportation and internet, numerous countries in the world can share their information and culture. Since there was active cultural exchange between Korea and America, several Americans have started to know Korean food's benefits and to be interested in them, and then the demand has increased. Especially, the superiority of Kimchi is so well-known, `Kimchi cans are on sale.' How about eating really nice Kimchi? Kimchi is waiting for you to eat it!",0

1419,"This is raw CACAO powder NOT COCOA powder.  This is NOT like Ghirardelli's or Hershey's or Nestle's or Swiss Miss cocoa powder.  This is NOT a direct substitute for those products in cooking or making hot chocolate.  There is no sugar in this product, it is bitter (the way it was meant to be) and it is a different product.<br /><br />This is also made from cacao beans like chocolate but it isn't processed the same way.  This is a simply ground (minimally processed to remove the bean's husk) cacao beans. In fact, unlike cocoa or chocolate this is high in fiber and low in fat (17% of the calories come from fat content).  It is low in calories at 24 calories per tablespoon. It also has ALL the health benefits of chocolate at a much, much higher concentration than even the darkest chocolate because the processing of chocolate/cocoa breaks down the healthy compounds.<br /><br />So, how do people use it?  I mix this product with hot chocolate mix to add a little bite to it.  I also add a level tablespoon to my coffee in the morning to give it a cafe mocha type flavor that I have grown addicted to!  People substitute this for cocoa only when they are either adjusting their expectations or their recipes.",1
1420,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).  Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness.  I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium.",1
1421,"I was so excited to get these because I thought it would be a great healthy snack to keep at my desk.  I ordered these and other flavor (double chocolate chunk) and after eating a couple of each, noticed that one of the cookies had bluish green mold on it.  I assumed it was a bad one in the batch.  I saw on the manufacturer's website that these should be stored in the freezer since the shelf life is 90 days (due to natural ingredients and no preservatives).  I immediately put them in the freezer after getting them 3 weeks earlier.  The next 4 cookies I opened had that same mold on it and after I examine the rest, I found that they all were moldy.  Apparently Amazon had them stored in their warehouse for a while before I rec'd them.  Since there were no dates stamped on the cookies, I have no idea how long they sat in the warehouse before I got them.<br />I will not be ordering these again and will be wary of ordering other food products from Amazon.com.  They were great about refunding my money and I will continue to purchase from amazon, just not short shelf life food items.",1

I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings.

I believe they added more of this new date and removed tiny amounts of other more expensive ingredients (protein powder).  That would increase the sugar  and calorie content as shown, lower protein levels, and raise the fat content slightly.  So, if these bars taste more sweet, have more fat and have more sugar, it's due to the extra content of dates (and maybe almond butter) and decrease in soy protein powder.<br /><br />That's my theory.<br /><br />Either way the bars taste pretty good right now - and there are no better alternatives on the market.",1

Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.

1444,"The Soda Club machine is great.  We enjoy all the flavors (excluding the mango one).  I read the other reviews, my family doesn't understand what after taste they are refering too.  I have been drinking Pepsi all my life.  It is finally great to have soda without aspartame and corn syrup!  Plus, I am saving lugging 2-liter jugs from the grocery store and have cut down on the amount of garbage I throw out.  There are a lot of flavors at [...].  Yeah for Soda Club!!",1
1445,"After a terrible accident killed one of my two cats, I got very concerned about her surviving sister's well-being.  Call it obsessive, but I started reading books on cat first aid and cat health and nutrition, and one day I was filling her food bowl and I happened to glance at the ingredients in her dry cat food.  It was then that I realized that the dry food I was feeding her was JUNK!  No nutritive value at all!  (She was eating Meow Mix, because she seemed to like it, but not anymore.)<br /><br />Cats don't need cornmeal or veggies or soy or ""natural flavoring"" (by the way, I found out that most pet products are ""naturally flavored"" with manure...that's right, MANURE).  Cats don't need fish flavored cereal.  They need high quality protein, plain and simple.  And this is probably the best stuff I've ever found.  No grains, no by-products, all natural, and my cat loves the stuff.<br /><br />Before I started her on this food, she was sedentary and overweight, and she was throwing up a lot.  I always thought it was hair balls, but really I think it was her diet.  Since I switched her to this diet, she seems to have a lot more energy, she runs around and plays a lot more, she's lost weight, her coat has gotten shinier and silkier, her eyes have cleared up, and she never throws up anymore.<br /><br />It's a lot more expensive than other kinds of dry cat food, but really, you wouldn't feed your kids junk food with no nutritive value just because it's cheaper, so why would you feed junk to your pets?  I honestly think it's worth the price.  It's a great product, and I think I'll be feeding it to my cats for many years to come.",1
1446,"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,""<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating.""",0

1458,"So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!!  Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good.  The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor.  This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites!  I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />  - Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful.  They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor.  The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!",1

1460,"I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.  It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm.<br /><br />Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I give it 5 stars.",1

1464,"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]",1

1473,"Back when I used the breeze cat system, there were 4 cats in the apartment (2 are my cats, and the other 2 were my brother's cats that I was temporarily taking care for him).  I had the breeze next to the original litter box for 3 days and none of the cats used it.  They all went on top of the pellets to check it out but did not pee/poop in there.  One of the cats tried to eat a pellet and I took it away from him.  I *think* none of them actually ate it.<br /><br />On the 4th day, I took the original litter box away, and then they all started using the breeze.  There were no ""accidents"" in the apartment and I did not find pee or poop on the floor or carpet.  I think the fact that I placed some of the pellets with their original litter really helped them get accustomed to the product (and also since the breeze system was sitting there for 3 days, they were at least familiarized with it).<br /><br />The pad that sucked up the pee worked really well.  I experimented to figure out the right time to change the pad for the 4 cats.  It turned out to be every 3 days.  As for hard poop, I was ok with it staying at the top of the system and would pick it up with a plastic bag and throw it out (very easy).<br /><br />The problem is with the runny/watery poop which will go all over the pellets and is tougher and takes longer to clean.  A lot of the pellets ended up getting thrown out once the watery poop touched them.  Also, this system does not do anything to help minimize the poop smell, which is the main complaint for my boyfriend regarding this system.  In the end, we did not keep the breeze because the smell was too horrible.  Even if you clean it up immediately after the cat pooped, the smell was still there.<br /><br />We went back to the original litter box.  I am going to keep my eye on this product to see if tidy cats come out with better pellets that will do something about poop smell.  If that time ever comes, I would buy it because I know my cats will use this system & it did wonders for the pee... now if only the poop situation works out!",1

1480,"OK, so I'm used to drinking (and have a preference for) the cans that have the aluminum top you peel back--it's a teeny tiny frustration to have to, well, clean the inevitably dusty, traveled top of any can, whether with a damp towel, rinsing, or my shirt if I'm not feeling particularly energetic.<br /><br />That said, the price through Amazon (at $2 higher than The Chef's Warehouse that charges $9.95 for shipping) is much better, and this is JUST the kind of thing that, while it's pretty near-identical the price of my local grocer, I appreciate not hauling far.<br /><br />Now about the soda... I'm NOT a soda drinker. I abhor that corn syrupy colored mess called cola (though Cheerwine keeps a spot in my less than three!)... in general, my stomach, as I sort of banned this drink category for 360+ days a year at the age of 13, gets very upset when carbonated water is put in it, especially with caffeine in most carbonated things... and another interesting tummy woe is orange juice. Unless it's fresh squeezed and ""normal"" orange juice (not the awesomely rich Florida kinds of oranges), well, I'm sorta not able to handle that, not even after prilosec entered my world.<br /><br />Now for the confusion. This stuff... it tastes amazingly fresh, the carbonation isn't excessive, with 18% juice, I get some natural vitamin C (pills are no good anyway, not for 99 thousand out of 99,001 people), and I'm not drinking pure buzzed OJ. I am also not getting mouth sores or anything of the sort that I recall getting when OJ was one of those everyday 12 ounces of it items... yeah, I wasn't terribly smart, but then again, metabolism of a hummingbird forgives just about all food habits... I'm older, wiser (don't use semicid), and this is that mature drink for me...<br /><br />I think it is perfect for people who, like me, can't do straight OJ, who can't quite bring themselves to inhale pure sugar/corn syrup sodas, who don't want their drinks tasting like food coloring, you get the picture... it just tastes like a fresh citrus spritzer, like the bubbling of champagne with the juice content of a margarita and no alcohol. If you like tonic water, this could replace that kind of unhealthy addictive drink (for your eyes in particular, as quinine leads to blindness when used for more than a couple months). If you like margaritas or screwdrivers or want some fizz without it being fake Fanta fizzle, then this is what to drink.<br /><br />It isn't particularly surprising (to me) that this happens to be my run-to drink when I'm eating cheesy Italian foods... it seriously was made FOR rich Italian dishes (seafood, I'm not so sure on--I think vino would be better for fish dishes)... plate me up something with creams, cheeses, maybe prosciutto and butter sauces, etc... and this somehow feels like its bubbling acid is helping my stomach along--maybe just because the most healthy of adult tummies still (well, when the diet has gone adult and is less saturated with fats, less gooey, less fried, less American in general) have some trouble digesting cheese on cheese on gooey awesome cheese with some roasted-in-olive-oil veggies, of course, and the occasional land mammal commonly consumed in Italy.<br /><br />My point? If you're eating pizza, calzone, lasagna, or even other Euro-derived foods... or if you're eating some fried chicken, even, this drink is an amazing counterpart. If you take anything like proton pump inhibitors regularly (prilosec, aciphex, etc., or even zantac types of meds), then this could be that perfect add-on when you go off your healthy food diet and splurge for something you know might irritate. No, I'm not selling it as a medicine, though mmm this DOES remind me of when cola used to be good stuff (when it was just a bit of sugar and when real cherries were in the cup) and why they decided to put some things in such syrups to deliver more effectively... it's darn good stuff. It's NOT your everyday soda. To my knowledge, they are adamant against using corn syrup, and having had the stuff in blue, in pale blue/yellow, and in a couple other cans, also having had it in glass bottles (panna is also made by them, so you can imagine the quality of the water that goes into this drink!)... well, it's all been some water, some OJ, some sugar (but not a lot), some natural CO2, and ... maybe natural flavor? Hmm, would have to get off my currenly lazy rump (with a currently terrible signal to post this review) and check... but I do indulge in this one soda here and there, despite ""knowing better"" from years in med school and more years teaching integrated nutritional sciences alongside medicine (to try targeting the source of so many health woes, we really DO have to check in on our diets!)...<br /><br />As long as it stays caffeine free and low on the carbonation (which is reckless and artificial in US sodas--really disgusting and rather harmful)... then I'll drink this... not daily, but maybe go through a 6 pack or 2 in a month, depending on just how often I do splurge on foods that my stomach feels just a bit... weighted down by... and I can even drink it on an empty stomach, meaning the carbonation is seriously low compared to our crazy sodas and ""energy"" drinks.<br /><br />Mmm, I think my lazy rump might need a bit of sizzling refreshment in the form of aranciata san pellegrino... the healthiest soda I've found SO FAR that still keeps its cost around a buck with tax.",0

With the gain a little over half way on the Icicle and about 58% in Garage Band I got hot horn lines with gain to spare.  Any hotter and they would have started clipping, so it definitely gave enough signal to get the job done.<br /><br />Cons. The gain knob has no dial or indicators for how far you have turned it - it has to be done by feel making it almost impossible to duplicate your settings exactly. This could be improved with a knob with an arrow and a marked dial so you can see where it's set. It also feels a bit cheap - it's lightweight and feels almost fragile. Treated with care it's fine, but I doubt it would take much abuse before it would break and I have been ultra careful with it because it feels so lightweight and cheap.  I also used it as recommended in the accompanying literature and didn't plug it directly into the back of the mic - I used it with a mic cable.<br /><br />For what I needed it was perfect - simple plug and play that got good sound into my computer, and it worked well in a pinch.  I just wish it was a little higher quality in terms of construction.  A bit heavier and a better dial for the analog gain, and I would have rated it a full 5 stars but as it is, I can at best give it 4.",1
1482,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.,1

1484,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.",1

1488,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all!

I admit, the smell is quite nice right when you open up the packet.  But once you steep it, all the taste and aroma goes away.  I had to force myself to drink this on three separate occasions just to make sure my taste buds didn't just have an off day or something.  I seriously can't drink this flavorless ""tea"" anymore and am throwing the rest away.  Good thing it wasn't very expensive.

The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.<br /><br />Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism.

1503,"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina簧 Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".<br /><br />Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.<br /><br />My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution.",1

1505,"I received my 70 cup sampler pack, but had low expectations about the packaging and concern about the expiration date on the cups.  Looks like whoever makes these packs read up on the reviews.  My cups arrived in a beautiful box with a flip top and each cup nestled in its own little 'cell'.  Beautifully packaged and absolutely ideal for gifting.<br /><br />The 70 cups were unique, although there was more decaf than I need at least there werent 15 different french roasts and 15 different hazelnuts!  I sampled about 10 expiration dates and they were all in the future, from 2-5 months away.  I have heard about some problems with many k-cup manufacturers giving incentives to their production folks for how many they turned out, but someone forgot the sales incentive because they made way more than have sold, so many places allegedly have expired or nearly expired cups.  Glad to see that wasnt a problem here.  I found at least six coffee's I havent tried yet (and I've had a LOT of different k-cups) but wanted to before buying a big box of them.<br /><br />Very pleased with the purchase.<br /><br />Edit: I've pretty much given up on Crazy Cups variety boxes at this point.  While I was happy with them at first when I wrote the original review, my last order for a summer variety had christmas cups in it, and the most recent 70 pack was about half decaf and the grove square powdered cups.  Guys, most people don't drink any decaf, let alone in these volumes and the powdered stuff not only clogs the nozzles on the brewer, you can get a packaged powdered coffee/hot cocoa/whatever for a lot less money and the quality is better in the packages.  Most of the powdered cups have nasty oils in them and fake sweeteners.  Ick.<br /><br />So since these guys aren't focused on delivering a quality product, at these prices I can just buy a bunch of regular variety packs without the decaf and powdered cups and get a better price per cup.",1

1514,"Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!!<br /><br />Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not.<br /><br />Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It's called miel de agave, and it's made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup.<br /><br />But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, ""Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s."" In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation's website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write,<br /><br />Agave ""nectar"" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave.<br /><br />The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into ""nectar"" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS.<br /><br />Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.<br /><br />So please. I implore each and every one of you to do your own research on this sham of a product and tell everyone you know. Write letters and let the world know that we won't fall prey to loopholes in ""Organic Marketing"". The fact that so many people use this because they are diabetic is quite frightening.",1

1516,"I used to buy 100% natural fruit roll-ups at a local fruit market down the street from me. They were sold individually for like 65 cents apiece and were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. They were nothing like the fruit roll ups for kids you find in the grocery stores today. Those things are gross and have no resemblance whatsoever to a real fruit roll up. I used to literally buy like $50 worth at a time and would just eat one after another after another. In particular the Apricot and Strawberry flavors were just outstanding. Anyways, I went to the market one day and they had gone out of business. That was about 8-9 years ago. I tried finding a different store that carried them and to this day I have been unsuccessful. I tried finding them using the internet but unfortunately I just cant remember the name of the company to save my life. I just remember they were sold individually, were round and actually quite large in diameter, and they came attached to a piece of cellophane.<br /><br />I came across Stretch Island Leathers on Amazon just a few weeks ago and got extremely excited after reading the description as it sounded exactly like a fruit roll up, just presented differently. While a Fruit Roll-up is large and thin, The Fruit leather is small and thick. Anyways I immediately order a box of the strawberry and anxiously awaited its arrival. I received my shipment 2 days later and immediately ripped open the box and dug in. They were exactly what I was looking for and they were just as delicious as I remembered them to be. I would up eating one after another after another, just like I used to do, until I had a fairly large pile of wrappers sitting in front of me. I honestly cant even express how excited I really am. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I found it on Amazon which means I can buy them in large quantities for a very reasonable price. On top of that Amazon offers them on a subscription based service so I don't even have to trouble myself with re-ordering more.<br /><br />The bottom line - Stretch Island Leathers are OUTSTANDING and my hunt is finally over. If you are a big fruit lover than you simply have to give these a try. Of course these are not just for adults, in fact these are absolutely perfect for kids especially if your trying to cut down on the amount of junk food your kids eat.

1521,"I've taken to making cupcakes and cookies and making icing letters on them...  you know, an ""H"" on one cookie, ""A"" on another, and so forth, and arrange the cookies or cupcakes to spell out HAPPY BIRTHDAY or whatever the occasion might be.  I prefer bold, rich colors, like jewel tone colors, so these gel colors fit the bill to get the bold color without watering down my icing.  Only takes a few toothpicks of color to get what I'm looking for, so each 1/2 ounce color is going to go a long way.  A good buy, all around.  I will never go back to regular liquid food coloring!<br /><br />Also, I know others have stated this but I'll say it again, the black color is good but you have to start with a chocolate icing, not a white icing.<br /><br />**Update** I found another use for these Wilton colors by making colored sugar.  I've used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar (bigger crystals) and it works great either way, but the sparkling sugar is more, well, ""sparkly"" which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with.  Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag, take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it, then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag. (Does that make sense?)  Zip up the bag, then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed.  The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar.  Then spread the sugar out on a plate or a sheet of foil to dry for a few hours.  Voila!",1
1522,"My cat is a picky eater, and loves his chicken. So Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken has been a huge hit with Hercules for the past year or so. That is, until the last two cases. I've been noticing that it looks a little grey, and not so much like freshly cooked chicken. Then I realized that I was throwing out about 1/3 to 1/4 of each serving, something that never happened before. Then I happened to compare an older can with one of the newer ones: Bingo! While the ingredients are the same, it looks like the amount of potato starch has been vastly increased. And the cat doesn't really like it as much.",1
1523,"I am so excited to see Amazon offering the Van Houtte k cups. They are by far my favorites. This one is my husbands favorite. I am not big on the fruity flavored coffes, but I love the way this one makes the whole room smell. I was surprised that I like this one. These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.",1

The quality/uniformity of those other seeds was nowhere near these from The Sprout House.<br /><br />If I am buying alfalfa sprouting seeds, I will ONLY buy these.

1525,"Fast forward to January 2012, this is the best tasting one out there.  I am a coconut water fan and have tried them all.  ONE used to be the best before they move their production to another country.  There is something about coconuts from Brazil.  They are not as sweet and offer a more nutty flavor if that's what you are looking for.<br /><br />This brand has a very subtle taste so if you coming from the sweeter brands, you will not like it.  With all the other brands moving their production to other countries and no longer using coconuts from Brazil, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Below is a review from about about year and half ago.<br /><br />I have tried about 5 brands of coconut water, Amy and Bryans, ONE, Nature Factor, Zico, and VitaCoco.  This one has the most subtle taste of all of them and looking at the nutritional listing on the box, seems to contain the least amount of sugar.  For some, it might taste like water since the flavor does not seem to come out compared to the other brands.<br /><br />Amy and Bryans and Nature Factor coconuts are way too sweet for my taste and I think they get their coconut water from Thailand.  Vita Coco tastes a bit tart.<br /><br />Zico used to be my favorite before they switch from all natural to concentrate and though I have not tried it, based on other people's reviews, it does not come close to any of these particular ones.<br /><br />So in the end, ONE coconut will be the brand I will continue to buy and if Zico comes back into the market, I might pick them second.  For my taste, the ONE brand tastes the best.",1
1526,"I always used to hate mayonnaise, and couldn't imagine using it as a regular condiment.  Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.<br /><br />Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami.  Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.  Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings.  That hint of umami makes all the difference.<br /><br />Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans.  Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better.",1

1557,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",1

1564,"As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />A word about polenta:  Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by ""grilling up"" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.",1

When I removed the cover the smell burst forth like chicken poo from hell! I hoped the smell would go away when I added the TVP to the pasta, red sauce, and mushrooms but it didn't.

1578,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating.

Tophe pure rice bran oil 1/2 gallon, here on Amazon, was the best value I found.<br /><br />It tastes delicious on salads and in cooked foods.  I think it is the most tasty cooking oil I've ever used.  I like it better than olive oil or coconut oil because it doesn't have a strong flavor that would conflict with some foods.

I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.

My husband and he often have a glass together at the end of the day and we thought the glasses would be better than the coffee mugs they sometimes use!<br /><br />I wasn't sure why this glass was specific to whiskey or scotch. I did look for information about the Riedel types and shapes. According to the manufacturer, the company did research with the help of master distillers in Scotland. This resulted the design of a glass that is an elongated thistle shape on a truncated stem.  The design incorporates a small, slightly out-turned lip which directs the spirit onto the tip of the tongue, where sweetness is perceived, and serves to emphasize the elegant creaminess of top quality single malt whiskey.<br /><br />There are two lines of this glass, the Sommelier and the Vinum. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DZDTZ"">Riedel Sommeliers Series Single Malt Whiskey Glass</a> is also available here at Amazon. The Sommelier items are more expensive as the upper part is blown into a mold and the the stem and base are hand-crafted.<br /><br />The Vinum is machine made and more reasonably priced. The Vinum looks very lovely and is very nice and thin, there are no seams on the bowl, stem or base. (The Reidel name is etched on the bottom of the base.) It is made of over 24% lead crystal. The glass is 4 1/2 inches tall. There are 2 glasses per box, they are hand wash only. The box is sturdy and was in perfect condition when they arrived (I worried about this a little bit with such thin glasses.)<br /><br />My husband feels the glasses indeed improve the taste of the scotch, but he isn't sure why. He also said it also makes you appreciate the whiskey more and pay attention to it when you are drinking with the special glasses. They made a beautiful gift with a bottle of his favorite drink.

1618,"As we all know, the world is about to be consumed by a massive blob of crude oil gushing out of a hole in the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The oil rig that made the hole in the Gulf floor in the first place was owned by a little Mom & Pop concern called British Petroleum. ""BP"" is a scrappy little underdog of an oil company that was just trying to compete with the other giant, evil oil companies. They are the noble little corner grocer whilst other oil companies are analogous to Wal-Mart and as such the oil rig used by BP didn't have all the bells and whistles of the oil rigs used by the ""Big Box"" oil companies, bells and whistles like a simple battery that was supposed to have powered the alarm system that would have stopped this entire disaster from happening. You just know those batteries have got to be VERY expensive if it's cheaper to take a chance on a disaster that will cause untold and possibly global economic and environmental damage. We can't hold the lack of obviously expensive safety equipment against BP however, as oil companies operate on the slimmest of margins and usually don't return much of a profit to The Stockholders, who are people too.<br /><br />  BP tried to stop the gusher with something called a Top Hat and then a Hot Tap. These didn't work so they moved to their well thought out and scientifically tested Plan C, which was to stop the oil gusher by shooting golf balls into it. Surprisingly this didn't work so they attempted to shoot other things into the hole, up to and including: tennis balls, those tiny sponge dinosaurs that grow to enormous size when you get them wet, Swanson Hungry Man dinners(abandoned when deemed more dangerous to ocean life than the oil cloud), a gelatinous sludge vacuumed out from behind Kirstie Alley's knees and the entirety of Rush Limbaugh.( Adding Rush to a monstrous cloud of oil only resulted in a larger and more powerful Limbaugh, which is still being combated by the military as I write this).<br /><br />  Luckily, those feisty little can-doers down at BP hit upon a sure fire idea. They are going to shoot thousands of tons of fresh whole rabbits into the hole. Why will this work when the other methods failed to produce results? Let me answer your question with a question of my own...What is the universal symbol of luck in modern society? The rabbit's foot. And these whole rabbit carcasses are lousy with them. BP engineers have determined that these rabbit carcasses, because of the association between rabbit feet and superstitious luck, have a greater chance of plugging that hole than almost any other method. A wise man once said that any problem the mind of man can set, the mind of man can solve. So I'm not worried folks, this time things are sure to work out. If they don't however, I'd warn any leprechauns you care about to leave the country for a long, long time.",0

1620,"Hello Raw Cacao Lovers!<br /><br />Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao:<br /><br />Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e. ""raw""), there is no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present in cacao.<br /><br />Recently, highly trafficked websites such as[...] have highlighted the misinformation of cacao's supposed vitamin C content. Included in these reports are claims that raw cacao is ""extraordinarily high in vitamin C.""<br /><br />Back in 2004, our Navitas Naturals lab tests directly looked for vitamin C content in raw cacao, but came up negative. Despite these results, the current media blitz brought us back again for another round of lab testing of our best-selling raw cacao products (beans, nibs and powder) for vitamin C. This time, we used two different laboratories instead of one, and utilized three different analytical methods: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Capilary Electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection, and Titration.<br /><br />Though all three methods have their place in the scientific community, Titration is the most commonly used method in the food industry when determining vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content. However, there is a critical detail within the Titration method many companies miss when testing raw cacao. The method of Titration is unable to differentiate the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from the vitamin's analogs. The result is what is known as a ""false positive.""<br /><br />This is why, at Navitas Naturals, we use HPLC when testing raw cacao's vitamin C content. The HPLC method looks directly for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and not just the analogs. Additionally, after sending samples of our products to another lab to test using the CE method, the reports returned consistent the HPLC results.<br /><br />We have now also tested one of the largest raw cacao brands in the United States using the Titration and HPLC methods. And yet again the results confirm our previous conclusion that raw cacao has no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present.<br /><br />Cacao is a tremendously beneficial superfood, containing a wide spectrum of minerals and phytonutrients. It is important to be clear however, Vitamin C is not amongst these nutrients.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Zach Adelman, President<br />Navitas Naturals",1

1622,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.,1

Uh-oh, wrong product? I compared the box to my old one and found the same SKU number but the roast level has been dropped from medium to very light along with the color change. My taste test revealed exactly that... a mild, relatively tasteless coffee more like their dishwater Daybreak than the old Caribou blend. Caribou (I got this second hand) claims that their flagship blend is more of a light roast than a medium roast and they made the change accordingly. Yeah, sure. Nice try but we all know that the wholesale price of coffee has skyrocketed. Sounds to me, the skeptic, that perhaps they have been forced to switch to a cheaper coffee with less gusto and more bitterness to maintain their competitive price points. How sad. I would have gladly paid more for my favorite. The new blend is far inferior. If you're a regular, have someone brew both and I bet you'll have no problem distinguishing the difference. Time for a new favorite with a company that doesn't play sleazy tricks on its loyal customers. If and when prices return to normal, watch the return to the old orange based on ""we listen to our customers"" and more corporate-speak BS.",1

1630,"I discovered this great product about 2 months ago and since then have consumed five jars of it. I love it. Hardly a day goes by when I don't have some. No it isn't peanut butter but it has a near nutty taste and mixed with some of the Walden fruit spreads (raspberry seems to work best) makes a great peanut butter/jelly taste to use on crackers, bread, etc. The consistency is pretty firm although not as thick as regular peanut butter it's perfectly acceptable (to me). The color is fine a bit darker than regular peanut butter (not that you can taste color - but it does influence people's opinion). I rarely take the time to write product reviews and was shocked when I came here to look for another Walden product to find that so many people had left negative reviews of this product and felt compelled to leave a more positive opinion. I think if you like Diet Coke and understand that it's not regular Coke than you will understand this product isn't Peanut Butter but just as Diet Coke is a good substitute for Coke and saves you about 200 calories a serving that this ""Peanut Spread"" is a good alternative to regular peanut butter and will save you about 200 calories a serving (2 Tablespoons).",1

But I must disagree with most reviewers and warn you...it is not a sauce for all purposes.<br /><br />If you're looking for a general-purpose pepper sauce, then be aware that peppers are the third child in this mix, behind eldest sibling - garlic, and middle child - sugar.<br /><br />Because of that, it will compete with the flavor of most foods, not compliment them.  This sauce will not be a component of what you are eating, it will be THE flavor, dominating all else.  That's OK for bland dishes, but a disaster for others that have already complex flavors.<br /><br />If you like the classic asian combination of initially sweet, then lingering heat, you cannot go wrong with Sriracha.<br /><br />If yer from Minnesota or Wisconsin, stay away from 'dis an' stick with dat super-spicy tomato ketchup, ya betcha!",0

It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better.  We already have enough cancer in our family.  I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans.

1641,"Well, I'm now truly 'Ratch free.<br /><br />And all I have to say is, ""Wow.  I never thought it would happen to me.""  I can't believe what's all happened since I was found face-down in the grocery store aisle with a half-full bottle of Sriracha stuck up one nostril and and the other half the bottle dribbling out the other nostril.<br /><br />Worse, my mouth was stuffed full of sirloin tip samples that I - at least this is what I'm told - wrenched from the Sample Lady at the condiment end-cap.  Evidently, I saw how she dabbed her meat bites in a little plastic cup of house-brand barbeque sauce and the rest...is...my shame.<br /><br />The scene I made wasn't pretty. Suffice it to state, 22 people had Sriracha stains on their shirts and...that bottle stuck up my nose?  It was actually the third bottle I abused - the first one  used to drown the sample tray of steak tips and the second...well, I drank it like a little kid drinking Kool-aid on a hot day.<br /><br />My rage-filled rampage against the condiment companies and purveyors of flavorlessness saw no bounds.  I have a hazy memory of running stiff-armed, along an entire row of catsup bottles cascading them onto the linoleum.  The dull thuds of taught red plastic bouncing off the floor still haunts my dreams...<br /><br />Somewhere in the moments that followed, I found a frozen salmon and used it to knock out whole sections of Mexican, Italian, Chinese and fake Wasabi sauces into space - bang!  bang!  bang!

1642,"Despite the reservations I have about this product, CARNATION INSTANT BREATKFAST ESSENTIALS, COMPLETE NUTRITIONAL DRINK, NO SUGAR ADDED, 8.46 OUNCES, PACK OF 3 --I must say here that it tastes very, very, very, very, VERY G O O D : ),  (Yummy!!!!!)  It's somewhat of a misnomer, then, that I give it only two stars -- I DO like it -- but the only thing I like about it is the taste....and the fact that it mixes easily.  However, I do have very serious reservations about the sweetener combination which is in this product, and the fact that it labeled, (clearly, but in a place somewhat difficult to find on the label) NOT A LOW-CALORIE FOOD.....<br /><br />This powder mixes well with milk -- but, as with many ready-to-mix drinks, one must add the powder TO the milk and mix.  The old idea of adding a bit of milk to the powder, making a paste, then adding more milk, only makes for a cakey mess with these newer products.  So, it is curious to me that the directions on the back of the package say: ""TO MIX, Scoop 1/4 cup, or 4 level tablespoons into large glass.  Add 1 cup cold, fat free milk, stir.""  Well, I guess it could work both ways, (making a paste of a small amount of milk and a small amount of poweder is still not recommended here -- rather adding a lot of milk to the powder) -- but I find that adding the powder TO the milk works well for me.<br /><br />And yes, it is filling.  Not quite so filling as the NOW NUTRITION CHOCOLATE WHEY mix, (which I have also reviewed for Amazon) -- but this Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials Milk Chocolate No Sugar Added drink is much, much easier to prepare, and also has fewer calories.<br /><br />However, Carnation Instant Breakfast Drink Essentials Milk Chocolate, No Sugar Added, is NOT A LOW CALORIE FOOD.  It says so, in smallish letters, right there on the bottom of the left side of the cannister.  Just where a picture of the FRONT of the cannister, (most usually used to advertise this product), will NOT show it!  It's true that the only trace of sugar in this drink is from the lactose in the powdered,nonfat milk which is the first ingredient listed. This gives the product 7 grams of sugar.  Not a lot, but....  The strange thing is, however, that this product, though hiding the words, ""Not A Low Calorie Food"" on its label, actually HAS made me lose weight.  Yes, it took some effort -- but not as mcuh as usually.  BECAUSE CARNATION INSTANT BREAKFAST ESSENTIALS, (at least in this milk chocolate flavour), DID MAKE ME FEEL FULL, AND NOT TOO HUNGRY, FOR AT LEAST THREE HOURS!  It contains 60 calories per serving, (without milk), compared to 130 calories per serving, (also without milk), of the less-costly full-sugar version.  A low-calorie food probably has less than 60 calories per serving but, as the product here being reviewed DID make me feel full, (and also gave me vitamins and minerals), I was able to lose about 10 pounds using it as one of my meals each day.  But -- although I totally love chocolate drinks, it DID get a bit boring drinkng just this chocolate milk drink for one meal each day.  Hmmm...I see it ALSO comes, (in the sugared variety), in ""chocolate malt"" flavour,  Yum!  I've ALWAYS loved chocolate malteds, ever since I was little.  OK -- it will have twice the calories, but, even so....using 3 envelopes, (as I sometimes do), per 20-ounce glass size, this would give me 390 calories per 20 ounce glass.  Not bad or a meal.  The only trouble is, of course, that flavours OTHER than plain chocolate, (as is the item being reviewed here), plain vanilla and plain strawberrry, are available ONLY in 10 individual envelope boxes.  I like the freedom, (and lesser expense), of a cannister --which is why I probably bought the chocolate flavour, instead of the chocolate malt flavour, this first time.  Oh, well, I guess I can always combine them....<br /><br />The no-sugar powedered chocolate flavour, being reviewed here, (and probably most of the other flavours), contains powdered milk.  Which is nice if all you want to add is water.  However, the powdered milk used here, though fat-free, is NOT lactose-free.  Which is important, if you are lactose intolerant.<br /><br />True, there is no sugar in this product.  However, here is where I get very nervous reading the ingredients, and imbibing the product, however good it may taste.  For, what gives this product its sweet tast is two other kinds of sweetening: ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, and SUCRALOSE, (which usually goes by the trade name of SPLENDA.)  Sucralose -- as Splenda -- has been called the safest of the artificial sweeteners, in ""Eat This, Not That -- Supermarket Survival Guide"", by David Zinczenko and Matt Goulding, and is recommended, highly, by Dr. Jana Klauer, a Park Avenue, New York, diet doctor, in her book, ""How The Rich Get Thin"". Still, sucralose/Splenda has been linked to shrinkage of the body's vital ""t"" cells, (as these grow shorter, a person ages more), and, being made from sugar, (albeit changed from sugar by replacing one sugar molecule with another), it still oould, concievably, cause cancer, as it IS made FROM sugar to begin with.  However, I, personally, am much more concerned about the ACESULFAME POTASSIUM, (a.p.) sweetener in this product.  Although acesufame potassium is often mixed with splenda/sucralose in many products, I don't like the idea of ""a.p."" -- which has often been cited as a potential cancer causer, and, unlike splenda/sucralose, is NOT made from a naturally-occuring substance, (sugar) -- to be mixed with anything else. Except maybe with sugar itself, which is totally natural.  Mixing a.p. with anything else -- even the relatively safe(?) splenda/sucralose, raises little alarm bells in my mind.  Maybe I'm being overly cautious here --but when I mentioned this to my doctor, he agreed.<br /><br />Therefore, I feel this product should be used with caution, even by diabetics.  (Diabetics have enough problems --surely they don't need a potential cancer causer combination!)  The ""regular"", sugared variety of Carnation Breakfast Essentials, Milk Chocolate (or any other) Flavour, will be my choice from now on.  There is about twice as much product in the non-sugar-free variety.  This ""sugar-free"" variety has on its label: ""NOT A LOW CALORIE FOOD"", right there on the bottom left of the front of the label, as I have stated before. Still, as I also stated before, it actually did make me feel full....and therefore, did help me lose (a little) weight....<br /><br />But yes, this is yummy stuff.  Very, very tasty.  But I am reminded of a fairy-tale, in which a human man was captured by an ogre.  The ogre's wife gave him some oatmeal --poisoned oatmeal.  ""This stuff is good"", said the man.  ""Can I have some more?""  ""Certainly,"" said the ogre's wife.  Sadly, the man was soon not able to ask for a third helping....or indeed, anything else.<br /><br />Another reviewer has said that it gives him or her diarrhea -- but this can have a good effect on those beset with constipation!

1648,"I got the Beaba Babycook as a gift, and adored it for several weeks. I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans. Then, after about a month of regular use, I noticed a foul odor coming from the well where the water goes. I looked inside and saw that a brown crust had formed there. I figured it must be lime deposit that had turned brown from being exposed to the hot temperature of the babycook, but when I tried to descale the well, the vinegar did almost nothing to remove the brown deposit, even after several attempts. I was also very worried to see that the water that ended up in the steamer basket was brown, thus suggesting that if I tried steaming more veggies, the deposit would end up in my baby's food.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they recommended using distilled water (although there was no mention of this in the manual). So, I exchanged my now completely dysfunctional Babycook for a new one, and tried again. Within two days the brown film had developed, even though I was using distilled water. I don't know much about appliance design, but I figure there must be something really wrong with this gadget if it takes only a few days for such a deposit to form. And the odor is truly foul - no way I want my baby's food within a foot of whatever it is that collects there.<br /><br />I don't see any mention of this problem in other reviews, but at the same time, I can't imagine that I am the only person this has happened to, given that it happened TWICE to me.

None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called ""monosodium glutamate,"" had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When ""monosodium glutamate"" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" did not appear until ""monosodium glutamate"" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an ""industry arranged whitewash"" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers ""voluntarily"" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in ""low fat"" and ""no fat"" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using ""monosodium glutamate."" In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a ""clean label"" ingredient.",0
1662,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",1

1664,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0

It just doesn't taste right to me--almost has a funny aftertaste to it--like plastic or something, which in my book, shouldn't be there.

1669,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!",1

1671,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",1

1679,"I use this product frequently.  Like most tofu, you need to press it (between paper towels with a heavy skillet on top works fine) to get the excess water out.  The more water you can remove, the less you'll have to deal with sloppiness when cooking, something the previous reviewer did not like.<br /><br />As for a blank slate on taste, that's exactly what makes tofu great.  It will take on any flavor you want to impart.  Our most common marinade is placing the pressed, cubed tofu in a Ziploc with a mix of soy, honey, and lemon or lime juice.  A quick search online for a marinade will give you ideas (many also include minced garlic, ginger, etc).  You can also purchase a premade marinade, like a teriyaki sauce.  The more liquid the marinade (and the more water removed from pressing), the better it will penetrate the tofu.  Even a half hour in the bag works fine.<br /><br />We saute it right in the pan with the stir fry veggies (add tofu last--it just needs to get warm; or, for a firmer style, you can bake or ""brown"" it separately first) and pour in the remaining marinade as the final sauce (you can thicken with cornstarch if desired).  Handle the tofu cubes gently as they are not firm like most meats, but broken up pieces taste just fine too.<br /><br />Marinated tofu cubes also do well on kebabs with veggies on the grill.<br /><br />Plain tofu ""creams"" well and is often good in a dish that requires thickness.  We've made chocolate mousse with it as well as scrambling it like eggs.<br /><br />We have great success breading pressed cubes of this tofu just like you would the chicken in a General Tso recipe.  General Tso's Tofu is AWESOME.  The flavor comes from the sauce so you don't need to marinate first.<br /><br />Some people also freeze tofu--generally remove from packaging and press first--to give it a firmer consistency.<br /><br />Tofu is all about how you prepare it.  Most people will NOT like it plain, so don't expect to just dig a fork into it.<br /><br />This particluar product is great because of its all-purpose nature (firm is definitely better than soft for saute, etc) and its shelf life.  I would have given it five stars but the must-be-refrigerated versions packaged in fluid do seem to be firmer.  They don't last as long in the house, though, so this is a perfect choice to keep in the pantry (usually dated a few to several months out).",1
1680,"I've seen advertisements for 5 Hour Energy products for months now, and I finally gave in yesterday.  I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the ""discounts"" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn't go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn't actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.

I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!",1
1688,"When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!",0
1689,We bought this from a candy shop a couple of years ago. Make no mistake - this is not chocolate and it has no chocolate flavor. The orange in its name refers to the color it changes - not to its flavor.<br /><br />The directions call for you to mix the powder with hot water. If you do this it will taste terrible. It becomes only mildly acceptable (to some) when mixed with hot milk rather than water.<br /><br />Its only real use is that the empty cauldron can be used for a decoration around Halloween.,1
1690,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.",1
1691,"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al",1
1692,"This robust flavor stands up well to a travel-sized mug and is indeed very smooth as described, but I didn't get an actual Kahlua flavor much, if at all. At first the flavor seemed to have a burned taste to me--the very flavor I was avoiding with the single serving Keurig system.  I decided to test it by adding some real Kahlua to standard unflavored coffee and found it didn't taste vastly different--so I guess this is how it is supposed to taste, but it's not what I expected.  The guy in the liquor store said that without the alcohol you wouldn't get the exact taste.  Overall, I found the flavor okay in a big mug (too strong for me in a cup) and the two-box pack is a good value.",1
1693,"This is a great seasoning.  My dad taught me how to cook and our favorite basic spice combination for meat, fish and poultry is salt pepper and paprika.  Decided to eliminate salt from my diet and tried a some supermarket brands that were not great.

The closest to salt(I can't taste the difference) but the mix of flavors actually work better with meat, poultry and fish.<br /><br />My only concern was using it in soups but I ground it up and it was perfect in my favorite summer soup (corn chowder with crab/shrimp).

I have NO idea what the 5-star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudo-food products.  I'm not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish, catsup, onions, mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery off-taste of these ""franks.""  My conclusion is that I think I'll eat all the condiments and dispense with this red-grey monstrosity.<br /><br />UPDATE: After reading responses to my review, I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER (sorry... just kidding...

Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.",1

Organic freeze dried corn tastes great and I usually eat it right out of the bag.<br /><br />Organic freeze dried corn has a light, airy texture that practically melts in your mouth. It has a fresh taste that reminds me of sweet corn right from the garden.<br /><br />Freeze-dried corn can also be added to your favorite recipes. And it will remain fresh when stored for long periods of time.<br /><br />But Sensible Foods Organic Sweet Corn, at several dollars for 0.75-Ounce, is way overpriced.<br /><br />Check out ""Organic Just Corn"" by a company called Just Tomatoes. Amazon sells it now. The product is just as good as this one and you get about 5 times as much for the price. The quality is as good or better IMO.<br /><br />Another option is Now Food Non-GMO Freeze Dried Corn -- but that is not organic. It tastes great, but I prefer organic.",1
1703,"Although any mom would prefer to feed their baby breast milk, there are circumstances that do not allow everyone to do so. I am stuck in that boat. So, I went on a quest to find the next best thing, organic formula. My son has been on Earth's Best formula since he was one week old and has no problems at all.<br /><br />Here is what I LIKE about Earth's Best:<br /><br />ORGANIC.  I am very conscious about what I put in my own body so I wouldn't not have it any other way for my son. The use of pesticides and genetically modified ingredients is a terrifying concept to me. EB contains no growth hormones, antibiotics, steroids or potentially harmful pesticides or herbicides.<br /><br />EASY TO DIGEST. My son has no fussiness or issues with this formula. He's happy and content and has had no issues with gas or spitting up due to the formula. My son was a very colicky baby but we had tested out a few formulas before concluding that it was definitely not the EB causing his fussiness.<br /><br />AFFORDBILITY. Due to the recent recall of Similac organic formula, Earth's Best became the only affordable organic formula on the market that I could find readably available. The only other option available on the market besides Earth's Best is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJM9SU"">Babys Only Organic Toddler Formula, Dairy Iron Fortified, 12.7-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 3)</a> and at nearly $30 for 3 cans of 12.7 oz of formula was out of our means. With Amazon subscribe and save, this formula is nearly the same price as non-organic formula. How could I even consider feeding my son anything else?<br /><br />These are the ISSUES I have with the formula:<br /><br />SYRUP SOLIDS. Sugar in formula? Excuse me! This is really disappointing but I believe the organic element of the formula far outweighs switching to a non-organic formula. As I said earlier, Baby Only is too expensive to even be an option for us. Plus, I believe the use of pesticides in formula ingredients is a far more dangerous concept than sugar!<br /><br />DHA/ARA. I am not a fan of the synthetically derived DHA/ARA found in EB formula. However, there are no affordable formulas on the market that have naturally derived DHA/ARA. Therefore, its hard to judge EB alone. The formula industry should be required to find a NATURAL way to derive DHA/ARA if it should be allowed to market their product as organic.<br /><br />CLUMPS. The formula can be hard to mix properly without getting clumps. It takes an extra amount of patience and time to mix this formula. The best solution I have found is to mix the formula in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001I481LM"">Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher</a>or use a handheld formula mixer such as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K4Q9BG"">Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer</a> when making one bottle at a time. This way I do not get the bubbles that form from vigorous shaking.<br /><br />Although the EB formula is not perfect, it is the most affordable organic formula made on the market. However, if it is within your means, you may want to do a little bit of research on Baby Only formula.",1

So loud you can't be in the same room with the thing and hope to get anything done that requires concentration (I'm a grad student and the AeroGarden has become my personal study albatross). Sooooo...thinking I needed to clean out the roots a bit better, I took it apart and went through the whole sanitation process, preparing the garden for my third planting. As soon as I plugged it back in, the pump roared to life and once again my living room was filled with a lovely, deep buzzing/humming sound. Other posters are spot-on about customer service - you simply cannot get through to these people. I've been on hold for 20 minutes and more before giving up each time - I'm hoping they'll send me a new pump, but I need to actually HEAR from a real person. It's great that they're nice and all - hey, we'd all be nice if we rarely actually talked to anyone!<br /><br />UPDATE: I sent one email and they responded within hours with an offer to send out a new pump, so my opinion of customer service has changed considerably - I'll update this review when I get the pump to let everyone know if that fixed the noise problem<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE: Yes, the new pump fixed the noise problem *and* customer service has gotten a LOT better. I've phoned a couple of times and got a live person, quickly, who was extremely helpful. Looks like the kinks are worked out from the original problems and I now wouldn't hesitate to pick another one of these gardens up.",1

I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!",1

1712,"First off, i definitely like hemp protein. This is the third bag i've ordered through Amazon but the first from Amazon.com. Having said this I'm not as happy with this purchase as I have been in the past. I know it's supposed to have a shelf life of a year but I'm fairly convinced I must have gotten a stale batch. The smell put me off initially, and when I went to make a smoothie out of it I couldn't finish it at all. The first bag I ordered (through Amazon from a company called Raw Foods) came in vacuum sealed and that one was perfectly fine. The second and third one was loose. So based on my experiences I would say that freshness matters somewhat. I tried searching for other folks experience with hemp protein but it's basically impossible to find any more critical reviews of it - all I ever seem to get is how much better the stuff is than Whey protein for bodybuilding.<br /><br />Anyway I much prefer the taste of Nutiva Hemp Protein moreso than the Living Harvest brand, and I did try to contact Nutiva via email about the possibility of a stale batch, but never heard a reply.

1720,"I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6"">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E"">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are: Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan, Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend, Tully's French Roast Coffee K-Cups, Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast, Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend and Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold.<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are: Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee, Emeril's K-cups, Big Easy Bold, Gloria Jean's Coffees, Black Gold Extra Bold, Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights, Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda and Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven: Tully's Full City Roast Coffee, Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide, Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend, Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups Dark Magic Extra Bold, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark and Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve.<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA"">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my k-cups in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in red sharpie, of course, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors that I'm going to wind up with. I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip. I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on coffee. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.",1
1721,"This coca leaf tea has a robust flavor, far more so than I anticipated.  Not bitter, just richer and fuller than most teas I have had.  It has a very mild stimulating effect, somewhere in between coffee and regular tea.  However, it is far more soothing than coffee; no jitters or shakiness.  I began having it in the mornings at work, and found it gave me the energy that I rely on coffee for, without feeling wired or sped up.  I can see why coca is so sacred to the Peruvians; there is a definite medicinal quality to it.  Not in flavor, just in how it effects the body.  Overall, I would say that tea drinkers (or coffee addicts looking to get off the Bean) should give this a try.  Tastes great, and does wake you up a bit.  I recommend!",1
1722,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.

If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.

1727,"My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No ""doggie junk food"" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.",1

It's also a light, non-greasy moisturizer that doesn't make the rest of my skin break out. I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescriptions that did nothing but make my face burn and itch more and in months could not do what this stuff did in days. My rosacea is not completely gone. I still have flare ups, but it is under the best control it has ever been. I am not a doctor and have no idea why this works, but in my opinion its a miracle.

1730,"Have never been a big meat-eater, but cut back even more a few months ago.  I began supplementing my diet with more beans/legumes, but was not feeling nutritionally satisfied, and realized I was not getting enough protein.  Did a little research, and discovered that hemp was ideal for meeting protein requirements, and according several articles I read, it has many other nutritional and health benefits as well.  I purchased the Nutiva hemp protein powder in conjunction with the Better Than Milk ""Rice"" (to avoid over use of soy).  According to directions for both products, I mix 4 tablespoons hemp protein and 2 tablespoons of  BTM, in water.  It mixes easily in a regular plastic shaker, and I don't even have to use the ""de-clumping"" attachment that fits inside the shaker. It's just Shake-N-Go! This combination has been the perfect way to start my day.  I was concerned about the taste, as some reviews I have read rated the taste of hemp very low. I can't speak for other brands, but the finely ground Nutiva hemp powder has a mild nutty flavor, and I LOVE IT. From what I've read, hemp does not contain oligosaccharides (which commonly causes ""gastric distress"" with soy proteins), and I have not experienced any bloating with the hemp and rice milk combo. I am happy to start my day with something both nutritious and delicious, and thank goodness I don't have to use the electric blender (one less thing to wash).  Also, the Amazon price on the Nutiva Hemp Protein and the Better Than Milk Rice can't be beat, and both qualify for free shipping.  FANTASTIC!!!",1
1731,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.

1734,"This is the most economical way to buy yeast even if you only bake with it 6 times in a year.  Do the math comparing the cost of those little packets & you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />This is an ""Instant"" or ""Rapid Rise"" yeast which should not be confused with ""Active Dry"".  Active Dry is dried at a higher temperature & therefore more of the yeast cells are killed.  If using AD, you need to soak/activate it in warm water before adding to dry ingredients.  This is unnecessary with Instant yeast; add it directly to the flour.  You also need to use more AD because more of the yeast cells are dead.<br /><br />I store mine in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator.  I write the expiration date on a label stuck to the lid.  It has always stayed active beyond the expiration date.<br /><br />This is the yeast to use if you are using a bread machine.  You can use AD yeast but it's more convenient to just dump all the ingredients in to a bread machine and let it do the work.<br /><br />You can substitute Rapid Rise/Instant yeast in a recipe calling for Active Dry yeast.  Use about 25% less Rapid Rise/Instant than the recipe calls for.  Example:  The Active Dry packets usually contain about 2-1/4 tsp./.25 oz. so use 1-3/4 tsp. Instant/rapid Rise yeast if the recipe calls for 1 packet (2-1/4 tsp.) Active Dry.<br /><br />You can also substitute Active Dry for a recipe that calls for Instant/Rapid Rise.  Use about 25% more Active Dry than the recipe calls for.  Example:  Use 1-1/4 tsp. Active Dry if the recipe calls for 1 tsp. Instant.<br /><br />1 tsp. Active Dry = 3/4 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise<br />1 tsp. Instant/Rapid Rise = 1 1/4 tsp. Active Dry<br />1 packet (2 1/4 tsp/.25 oz) Active Dry = 1 3/4 tsp.

1736,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0

1744,"After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market. Manufacturers like to insert grain into pet food to their reduce cost and create inexpensive calories. Grain causes alkaline urine in both cats and dogs. Alkaline urine leads to crystals and bladder stones and develops when an animal eats pet food with grains and fillers (high carb diet). Our pets need only meat, organs and water for proper nutrition and you are not ""spoiling"" your pet by feeding them an all wet food diet. Kidney failure is one of the most common diseases in cats and I have learned that I'm putting unnecessary strain my cat's kidneys by feeding him crap food. I purchased 8-10 grain free options for my cat to try out because it's very difficult to get an animal to change their diet once established. Weruva Paw Lickin Chicken was a clear winner with my cat Otis and I highly recommend it. If you think you can't afford a grain free diet for your kitty, please consider the $4,000 I have spent unblocking my cat's urinary tract when crystals formed (emergency procedure).

1745,"I bought these and the unsalted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.<br /><br />If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg ([...]), which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.<br /><br />If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back.<br /><br />It's been a while since I wrote this review and today, 4/9/2011 someone commented about my original review and the higher cost of the Williamsburg Brand peanuts. Of course, generally speaking, unfortunate as it may be, we often must pay more for healthier foods. Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to update my review. If there's a Costco near you, there's a Kirkland Brand salted peanut that they sell, in a rather large can. The peanuts are pure and unadulterated and only roasted in peanut oil; no unhealthy cottonseed oil like the Planter's. And, they are, I'm confident either less expensive or most certainly much more cost competitive than the Williamsburg brand to which I alluded in my earlier review. So, in this particular case, provided one has access to a Costco, one need not pay more for a healthier peanut.",0

1750,"Hello Raw Cacao Lovers!<br /><br />Here is the real truth about vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content in Raw Cacao:<br /><br />Despite the trafficked reports circulating the internet, the honest truth remains: even when processed at low temperatures (i.e. ""raw""), there is no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present in cacao.<br /><br />Recently, highly trafficked websites such as [...] and [...] have highlighted the misinformation of cacao's supposed vitamin C content. Included in these reports are claims that raw cacao is ""extraordinarily high in vitamin C.""<br /><br />Back in 2004, our Navitas Naturals lab tests directly looked for vitamin C content in raw cacao, but came up negative. Despite these results, the current media blitz brought us back again for another round of lab testing of our best-selling raw cacao products (beans, nibs and powder) for vitamin C. This time, we used two different laboratories instead of one, and utilized three different analytical methods: High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Capilary Electrophoresis (CE) with UV detection, and Titration.<br /><br />Though all three methods have their place in the scientific community, Titration is the most commonly used method in the food industry when determining vitamin C (ascorbic acid) content. However, there is a critical detail within the Titration method many companies miss when testing raw cacao. The method of Titration is unable to differentiate the vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from the vitamin's analogs. The result is what is known as a ""false positive.""<br /><br />This is why, at Navitas Naturals, we use HPLC when testing raw cacao's vitamin C content. The HPLC method looks directly for vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and not just the analogs. Additionally, after sending samples of our products to another lab to test using the CE method, the reports returned consistent the HPLC results.<br /><br />We have now also tested one of the largest raw cacao brands in the United States using the Titration and HPLC methods. And yet again the results confirm our previous conclusion that raw cacao has no vitamin C (ascorbic acid) present.<br /><br />Cacao is a tremendously beneficial superfood, containing a wide spectrum of minerals and phytonutrients. It is important to be clear however, Vitamin C is not amongst these nutrients.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Zach Adelman, President<br />Navitas Naturals",1

1753,"The turmeric arrived much faster than expected, and the quality was far superior than expected.<br /><br />I have used turmeric in my cooking for many years, both for Indian-inspired dishes and also for the coloring effects it adds to certain dishes or components of dishes.<br /><br />A few month ago, my mother got me into taking turmeric for the health benefits.  She was having extreme respiratory issues and problems with severe arthritis.  She had several traditional medical treatments and nothing seemed to be working.  After she did a bunch of research, she found a bunch of information regarding the health benefits of turmeric.  After taking turmeric twice a day for about 8 weeks, she was able to be taken off of oxygen and she no longer has problems with her arthritis.  She is no longer taking any other medications and has no further problems as long as she continues to take her turmeric every day.<br /><br />If you are planning on taking turmeric for the health benefits, I highly recommend you do some research first.  The basics are that you need to take about 1 tsp of turmeric mixed into a liquid that contains a fat (such as whole milk) along with about 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper (the black pepper helps with absorption and the nutrients in the turmeric need the fat because they are fat-soluble and not water-soluble).  Do the research before you begin and don't just take my word for it... there are a lot of very respectable medical institutions currently conducting research on turmeric for treating such things as arthritis, acne, joint pain, pain management, respiratory problems, and even cancer, so you should have no problems finding more information online.<br /><br />I usually just take powdered turmeric in a not-too-revolting mixture recipe that I got from my mother: I mix 1 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric in a 12oz glass of V8 along with 1 tsp of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 Tbs of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic.

I could not believe that I was experiencing nirvana from a sugar free product.<br /><br />About an hour into the movie however, things started to change and before long, it was as if the gates of he11 opened up in my room.  I could almost swear I saw the hand of Bealzibub himself reaching forth from the depths of a gaping, red fissure that had become of my rectum, claws and all scraping any which way they could to cause pain.  I was doubled over in agony--if the weatherman had come on television that evening I am sure there would have been a flash-mudslide advisory warning issued in my home as that is exactly what had happened.  My guts were on fire.<br /><br />I ended up creating a tar-pit that labrea would have been proud of.  If it were not for my beautiful wife, I could have become quite entombed within my abode and fossilized in the times gone by.  I will say this though, Haribo would _not_ reimburse us for damages to our door when my Wife came home and the brown flood of goop shot out through the narrow slit that she had created by turning the knob, busting it from its hinges into her.<br /><br />These gummy bears are an exquisite deficacy.",1
1758,There are a lot of inexpensive yogurts in the stores but I feel I want to make my own for many reasons.  It takes a little planning because the yogurt maker (also a Euro-Cuisine) needs 7 to 8 hours and I need to bring the milk up to proper temperature before adding the culture - but the end product is worth it.  As soon as I open a jar of the finished product I first smell it - you don't get that smell from the store brands.  This particular starter makes a 'thicker' variety like Greek yogurt and when you dip your spoon into it you see it.  Then the taste - there is a tang that I've never tasted in a store brand.  Most of the time I don't get around to adding any honey and grated lemon to it (my favorite) because if I start eating I can't stop.  The instructions are on the back of the packets and are easy to follow.  I like using whole organic milk from a local dairy so my experience is based on that - but I'm sure you get good results from low fat milk.  And I have also had success with allowing the yogurt maker to work over night - then I quickly refrigerate the jars in the morning to stop the culturing process.  For me it's not just about the cost it's more about the quality and sustainability of ingredients...it's food for my soul.,1

Also soy sauce (the fifth ingredient) contains MSG, also autolyzed yeast extract (the ninth ingredient) is MSG, and the seventh ingredient, natural flavor, can include MSG.  Basically you think you are buying a healthy organic product with no MSG when in fact you are buying MSG (with a few healthy vegetables mixed in). It is criminal to be able to market this product as having no MSG.  When is health going to take precedence over profit?  Shame on us.",0

1762,"Dogs are omnivores, meaning they can survive on a vegetarian diet, but by no means will they thrive without the inclusion of animal proteins. If you are genuinely concerned about the moral implications of a dog's diet and choose to feed this to your dogs, I would STRONGLY suggest supplementing this food with free range eggs, sustainably harvested sardines, or some other source of animal protein that you deem morally acceptable.<br /><br />I have vegetarian friends who feed their dogs this and other formulas, and when compared to my lab, who is fed a high- protein, grain- free dog food, they almost look abused. Literally, they are all very slim and their fur is coarse and patchy, as opposed to my dog, who is muscular, with fur is as soft as cotton, and as happy as can be.<br /><br />If you want an all- inclusive dog food that will handle your dog's nutritional needs, this is not the dog food for you.

1764,"I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain.<br /><br />I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time.  I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy.  The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch)<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops.<br /><br />The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper.

For peace of mind buy certified organic as farmers pay attention to detail, don't share equipment or bins, and are monitored strictly so they are paid a higher prices per pound. There's a difference in what kind of fertilizer is used on the land. Our organic seeds come from certified organic land which uses alfalfa as fertilizer, while our pesticide-free seed farmers have the option of using a synthetic topical on the soil, very much the same as liquid plant food you can buy for your house. This synthetic topical is man-made and not organic, which is why our Pesticide-Free product line cannot be certified organic.<br /><br />Also the tubs are gigantic which makes storing a pain. I've gotten a couple of tubs that needed to be cut open because it wasn't perforated and they couldn't be resealed which also was a problem because the product couldn't stay fresh.

Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil.

I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the ""solid"" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix.

1790,"After all the reviews i read and the experience i went through after buying this as a gift for my mom i had to come back and leave some proper feedback which i felt went against some of the more ""negative experiences"" others went through when buying this product. it seems like a few people before me had a decent response when it came to the quality of the gift in some of the areas such as delivery time, pricing, and even the assortment of the treats inside the box so i decided i would tackle each of those areas and explain my experience....<br /><br />-Delivery<br />out of everything that surprised me about this gift it was the amount of time it took to arrive that really made me satisfied. i was expecting the gift to arrive no sooner than Dec. 28 but it arrived on the 24th which was perfect timing on my part seeing how it was the only gift i could think about getting for my mom at the time (i ordered this on the 18th).<br /><br />The package itself was in good shape i guess....its just a cardboard box containing 20 or more pieces of candy. in terms of it not being packaged properly, it really wasn't that big of a deal as someone else made it out to be. every piece of candy was wrapped securely and placed in the box with little to no damage done (if i sound like someone who works at the company, i'm not.... i'm just an overall satisfied customer =D )<br /><br />-Price<br />Overall i think this would have to be the weakest area of the entire gift. while the box did contain a large amount of candy, i really don't think its worth $35. if the price was in the area of 18-25 dollars (at the most) then i would have gladly bought another one for my dad but at the time of purchase i was willing to take a chance just to see how good this box really was.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what one person was talking about when they said the total cost of their order including s/h was $51.  i managed to buy this for $35 with free s/h arriving 6 days later so.....i really don't understand how it managed to cost that much money in the end.<br /><br />-Selection<br />since i'm technically a 90's kid, there was only a handful of items i actually recognized. the few that i tried were just as i remembered tasting them years ago but i haven't really gotten into more of the older candies my parents were so fond of...<br /><br />-Overall<br />In the end it was a neat gift. it was interesting to see my parents go through the candy and talk about how the pieces they remembered and the ones that were new to them. if your looking for a gift that will bring back memories of a time long ago, you cant do much wrong by buying this as a gift though it will pinch a bit more at your wallet than its really worth. in total worth i would give it a 4/5 but in terms of packaging (which i originally thought was going to be abysmal), the free shipping & handling (must be only for the holidays?) and the ""just in time"" delivery it rounds up to a 5/5<br /><br />-Final Thoughts<br />if there was anything they could have improved on for there page here on amazon it would been a more descriptive list of what all came with the box including pictures of each of the candies inside......just for the consumers sake. sometimes i would like to know a little bit more about what i'm buying. either that or take a bigger picture of the entire product (i would have done it but i wasn't thinking about it at the time i received it)",1

1794,"I grew up in SE Alaska back in the 70's when the transportation infrastructure was not as good as it is today.  Sometimes, things like fresh meats, fruits, vegetables, and dairy were a bit expensive back then.  While fried Spam was not a staple back then for us, it was definitely a regular on the menu.<br /><br />Now in my mid 30s, I work a lot of late nights and was looking for something quick and easy to eat, yet actually has protein and is filling.  Walking down the grocery aisle, it jumped out at me, viola, Spam.<br /><br />While it no longer sports its key that you used to tear away that thin strip of metal, it was just as I remembered.  However, I no longer had the metabolism of a child.  I am already festively plump, so I figured I better lay off the blue Spam.<br /><br />So I decided to give the Turkey Spam a try.  At about half the calories and much less fat, how could I go wrong.<br /><br />What separates Spam from the cheap Wal-Mart knock off for me is that Spam has a nice firm texture which other imitation brands do not seem to have.  While I would give the taste of the Turkey Spam 4 stars, the texture was terrible.  The texture was soft and mushy, much like the imitation Spam products.  Personally, it reminded me of eating a can of cat food.  After eating a few slices, I could not bring myself to finish the can.  I did not try frying it.  Perhaps some further cooking would firm it up a bit.<br /><br />If you are a Spam addict and figure you need to shave some calories out of your diet, it is definitely worth a try.  The taste was not bad at all.  However, if the texture of your mystery meat products is important to you, I'd probably stick to Spam blue.",1
1795,"I've found this chocolate to be a great solution for my low carbohydrate diet.  This chocolate only has 5g net carbs per serving, but I find half a serving to be plenty satisfying for a chocolate fix.  Also, this has no artificial sweeteners, so I don't have to worry about digestive problems.<br /><br />If you don't like dark chocolate, you won't like this.  But if you're willing to savor the cocoa flavor, this is a great way to eat a small amount of chocolate without a lot of sugar.",1
1796,"My Vet recommended these for my dogs.  They completely remove the plack from the dogs teath and eliminated very expensive cleaning of the dogs teath.  It also eliminates putting the dog to sleep while cleaning the teath.  I take my dogs in about once a year and my vet looks at the teath and just says they look great - no cleaning required.  Before I found these, the dogs teath had to be cleaned about every 2 years.  Plus my dogs love the flavor of these.",1
1797,"I have enjoyed ""Goldfish"" and other cheese-based snack crackers since I was a child, but no more. I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.<br /><br />From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as ""health food,"" of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun!",1
1798,"This is great food; it has natural ingredients and is formulated to be as close as possible to a cat's natural diet. I switched my kitten to this food with NO issues, not even the smelly stools others complain about and I'll explain why. I am into body building and diet and I know that when you switch from bad food to good food, you actually need to eat less and adjust from there.<br /><br />The smelly stools occur when there is undigested (unused) protein in the stools. Thus you need to balance your cat's food intake and exercise so that he's getting enough food for his or her energy needs. Too little and your cat will definitely let you know, too much and the stools will let you know.<br /><br />I feed my cat Innova Wet and Dry food, leaving dry food out all day with one serving of wet food in the morning or at lunch time. Unless my cat has finished all his food early on in the day, I don't feed him any more of either; no matter how much he meows (it took about a week or two to change his routine). Also, if he's finished or nearly finished his food by the time I go to bed, I don't refill his bowl till morning.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend consulting your vet and watching your cat closely while adjusting his feeding. Watch for energy levels, alertness, responsiveness and overall demeanor.",1

What a mess, what an expense!  I then started trying the GF Flour blends like Bob's Red Mill, Pamela's etc.  Eh.. didn't care for them.  I stumbled upon Better Batter and gave it a try.  This stuff was made for GF newbies!  Substitution is close to cup for cup for wheat with the addition of a little extra liquid.  I am now making breads, cakes, cookies once again and having them turn out instead of flop or turn into bricks.  Wish I had known about Better Batter when we first started on the gluten free diet.  That would have saved me time and money.",1

So, being the nice person that I am, I invited he and some friends over for some Ham, Asparagus and a big pile of Yukon Gold Potato salad. And since it was hotter than blazes inside, I decided to heat the Ham and roast the asparagus and potatoes on the BBQ.<br />I slathered the Ham with my secret BBQ sauce, placed it on the cooler side of the Grill and about 2 hours later we were all sitting down on the patio with a big, hot, delicious, BBQ'd Ham staring us in the face.<br />The French Rose' was poured, the Meal was consumed and a good time was had by all.",0

1803,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",0
1804,"When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.

1808,"Fate has smiled upon you today, for you have stumbled upon a review of the best corn chips on the planet.  Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole ""organic"" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this ""red hot"" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.",1

Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.

My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.

The mesh screen severely restricts water flow forcing high back pressure on your Kurig coffee system pump. If you use the screen often this will shorten the life of your pot significantly. Back pressure is the slow death of any pump system, from the Kurig to your swimming pool. Reusing KCups solves this problem. Paper filters offer much less resistance to water flow.<br /><br />You also get a fuller, better tasting cup of coffee from the paper filter Kcup versus mesh.<br /><br />One negative, it is a slight pain to clean the Kcups for initial reuse, but not much more than cleaning the screen. After the initial cleaning, it is no harder than the mesh screen.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Extend the life of your pot and get a better cup of coffee.

He was not holding down any of his meals and this went on for a week! We took him back to the vet for x-rays and even an mri.. the vet found nothing. We took him off the Wellness and gave him chicken and rice.. he was fine... started mixing in Wellness again and he got sick. Took him off and we are giving him ground beef and brown rice.. he has not thrown up once.<br />Yesterday, we received a call from our friend who adopted Saki's brother. His brother has been on Wellness for the past week and guess what-- same exact symptoms as my dog!!<br />To me, this is sure proof of the Wellness being the culprit.<br />This morning, I researched this food more.. just type in a search engine- ""Wellness Super5mix sick"" and you will be sick when you read all of the cases of illness due to this product! Stay away from it.. don't risk it..<br /><br />Here is just one link-<br />[...]",0

1846,"I was very excited about purchasing this product as a gift for my father in law. I was however very disappointed when the product arrived. The basket it came in was very cheap looking. Also, the amount of nuts included was very minuscule. This product was definitely not worth the price. I am embarrassed to give this gift as it looks cheap and unthoughtful. I do not recommend this product unless you want to throw your money away.",1
1847,"First off, I have very little doubt that Newman's Own wet cat food is an excellent and healthy choice to feed one's cat.  Feeding a cat a quality food, even if expensive compared to other catfoods, is worthwhile and if it prevents one health problem might even pay for itself.  For those reasons, and because I support Newman's ideals in general, my cat has had the pleasure of enjoying many cans of Newman's food.<br /><br />However, in comparison to other cat foods in this price range, my cat does have a couple of complaints.  I should mention that my cat LOVES to eat, it is his primary motivation in life.  Need him to take a pill?  Just coat it in wet food and drop it in his dish.  But, because he likes to eat so much, he must also have controlled portions - 1/3 can, twice a day.  And that leads to his first complaint.  Open a can of Newman's, and there is a lot of empty space, around the food and even large open cracks in the food.  There certainly isn't the volume of solid food in a 5.5 oz can of Newman's compared to the competition.  The second complaint: Newman seems to love his brown rice, which is ok, but he keeps the grains big and whole.  My cat loves food, and cleans his dish every time... but he usually eats right around those big grains of rice.<br /><br />Basically, my cat isn't getting as much food from a can of Newman's as from his favorite brands (Nature's Logic and Innova EVO), so we'll be cutting Newman out of the rotation.",1
1848,"I'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff.<br /><br />This IS the KRAFT cheese powder! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it, and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags. All the same, its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn.<br /><br />To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese, so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta (uncooked) -- but you can experiment for yourself.<br /><br />In terms of making mac and cheese, I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk (as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump. The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn doesn't have, so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth.<br /><br />It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive (over twice the price of the item itself) but thats more about the post office than the company that sells it. Even so it still comes out cheaper than buying the little blue Kraft tubes of the stuff -- your not paying for the extra packaging.",1

1850,"When I first tried these confections many years ago (in the early 90's) I instantly loved them. They are toasted sesame seeds bound together with a honey glazing. That is all - honey and sesame seeds. But boy are they good and addictive. The only negative side to this treat is that the four individual wafers contained in each package tend to stick together and sometimes they do not break away cleanly from each other. This is to be expected though given the nature of the ingredients and is a small inconvenience. The product is made in, of all places, Poland and I find it gratifying to be able to purchase a product from a country that has come so far, economically and socially, in the last 20 years. If you want a simple, delicious, and nutritious confection, look no further - this is it.",1
1851,Excellent coffee product.  Bought for my espresso maker but also use in my drip coffee maker and is great either way.,1
1852,"I ordered this because I've been participating in a bone broth challenge, and we are encouraged to also use gelatin (which also naturally occurs in bone broth).<br /><br />If you're thinking about buying this, I recommend visiting the company's website; it has a lot of really good information, plus a couple dozen recipes for using gelatin.<br /><br />I was especially concerned about the MSG content, because I know that free glutamate typically occurs in gelatin.  Great Lakes has a whole page about MSG, though, including lab results indicating free glutamate content, etc.  It seems like a pretty safe product.<br /><br />So far I've been making homemade jello with my Great Lakes Gelatin.  Basically, what you do is heat up half a cup of fresh juice, add 2 Tablespoons of gelatin, and stir on low heat until it is totally dissolved.  Then let it cool, and add it into a bowl containing 1 1/2 more cups of fresh juice.  Stir until it is well combined, pour it into the container you want it in, and then let it set in the fridge for several hours.  I made this recipe with fresh cherries and lemon, and I left pieces of fruit in it, and added raw honey to sweeten it a little--it has been wonderful!<br /><br />Until I bought this I hadn't eaten jello in a long time because dessert jellos at the store usually have sweeteners, flavorings, colorings, etc that I avoid.  I'm really enjoying this Great Lakes gelatin, though.",1
1853,"I suffer from gout and get attacks every several months. Between attacks, my feet are swollen and painful. Dr put me on meds which i suffered side affects.  I heard about regular cherry juice helping gout and started drinkin it. I had No change.  I read about the Black Cherry extract and tried it. I started taking 2 tblsp of Black Cherry Juice extract at night and the very next morning all swelling was gone from my foot and I was pain free.<br />I take the extract every night now and have never had another gout attack! I also quit all my perscriptions!!!!  I read that the extract actually neutralizes the uric acid!  It works!  I have told many people about it and they too have had great sucess.  This stuff really works!!",1
1854,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
1855,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.,1
1856,"Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the ""old fashion way"" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!",1
1857,"Do not buy this product.  You will not be doing your infant any favors.  If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding.  (I know it's not always easy or convenient.)  If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing.  Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then ""fortify"" with synthetic vitamins/minerals.  Pathetic.  Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible.  There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk.  Sorry to be so matter of fact.  I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the ""green"" movement.

1858,"Confirmed Goji Berry causing severe nausia cramping and intestinal pain.<br /><br />I was introduced to goji berries during the summer as a friend I met had just opened a raw food cafe. His food NEVER (I mean never) gave me any problems it was all delicious and much of it was cacao and goji berries. He has very selective about his sources and does not trust many companies out there.(His Goji comes from Sunfood)<br /><br />When I returned home from Alaska I decided to try more superfoods and bought a trail mix by Navitas that was Goji, Cacao Nibs, and Cashews. That day I had a green shake for breakfast and a banana for a snack then just a pinch of Goji Berries afterwards. Within the hour I was writhing in pain and couldn't imagine what it was.<br /><br />This pain is severe. I wanted to die. It lasted about twelve hours. Including vomiting and diarrhea<br /><br />Next day I had a big green salad for lunch and then feeling better grabbed another SMALL pinch of goji and within 20 minutes I was in the exact same pain. I knew then it was the goji and instantly typed ""goji stomach ache"" into google and found threads verifying it.<br /><br />I called my friend and told him about my reaction and he asked me if it was Navitas.  I didn't recall and didn't have the bag on me but he said he bet 100% it was them.  He had similar reaction to their product and did hydrogen peroxide tests and found them to be rancid.  Got home and verified his assertion.<br /><br />Again, I never had this problem before eating Goji from Sunfood, but this Navitas is killing me.<br /><br />BEWARE: Detox can be painful enough even on a quality Goji berry.  You should start with very small amounts and I would recommend trying alternate brands NOT navitas.",0
1859,"I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1
1860,"Scientifically speaking, there is only one true cinnamon, which is most commonly called ""Ceylon cinnamon,"" and comes from the plant Cinnamomum zeylanicum. The other type of cinnamon which you find mostly in the grocery stores is called cassia cinnamon. If the label just says cinnamon, it is most probably cassia cinnamon. Why is this important?<br /><br />The term ""cassia"" never refers to Ceylon cinnamon but rather to other species of cinnamon, including Cinnamomum cassia (alternatively called Cinnamomum aromaticaum) and Cinnamomum burmannii. While most simply referred to as ""cassia,"" you'll often find Cinnamomum aromaticaum being referred to as ""Chinese cinnamon"" or ""Saigon cinnamon,"" and you'll find Cinnamomum burmannii being called ""Java cinnamon"" or ""Padang cassia.""<br /><br />Ceylon cinnamon is typically more expensive than any of the cassia versions, and it is also the cinnamon more closely associated with potential health benefits involving blood sugar regulation. To me, cassia cinnamon is stronger tasting while Ceylon cinnamon is more delicate.<br /><br />What true cinnamon and cassia do not have in common is their coumarin content. Coumarins are naturally occurring plant components that can have strong anticoagulant properties. Because our blood needs to maintain its ability to coagulate in times of injury, excessive intake of coumarins over a prolonged period of time can pose health risks. While the level of naturally occurring coumarins in Ceylon cinnamon appears to be very small and lower than the amount that could cause health risks, the level of naturally occurring coumarins in the cassia cinnamons appears to be much higher and may pose a risk to some individuals if consumed in substantial amounts on a regular basis. For this reason, organizations like the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany have recommended that large amounts of the cassia cinnamons be avoided.<br /><br />Since it is harder to find Ceylon cinnamon in the grocery store, you might find it at places like Trader Joes or whole foods. I do not have either of those stores within an hour drive, so I get mine at places like Amazon.com which has it in bulk at very good prices. This particular brand is a good price on Amazon.com and I just re-fill an old shaker I have on hand from the bulk bag. This is good cinnamon and a regular in my kitchen.",1

My favorite recipe being the low carb pancakes, the recipe is right on the package.

I don't give them daily, just a few times a week. I strongly suggest pet owners be present when pets are using a chew. These should not be used a pacifier when you are away.

1866,"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.",1
1867,"I am an enthusiastic fan of Sorghum. Have spread it on toast as if it were jam or jelly for more than 50 years.  And I was down to the last eighth of an inch in a jar a friend had picked up for me at a farm stand in Ohio.<br /><br />When I unpacked my 42 once jar of Amish Sorghum I noticed the label message that ""Cirtric Acid added to prevent crystalization.""<br /><br />That puzzled me, but I was looking forward to finishing off the old jar so I could try the new sorghum. When I dipped my spoon in I found it to be very thin,similar to a rich pancake syrup.  Most pure sorghum is much thicker and doesn't need to be treated by citric acid for any reason and I have had an open jar on a cupboard shelf for months without problems.<br /><br />This tasted fine, but at the end it had the aftertaste if honey. I believe these folks may be cutting their sorghum with honey. This is not the first time I have purchased a jar that was not pure sorghum. I have purchased it direct from farmers and found it was not the real stuff.  And that's what I think is the case this time.",1

1872,"I have to agree with previous reviewwers comments about the selection of herbs in this kit.  I would have preferred parsley, thyme and rosemary to some of the herbs in the kit.  Two types of basil is just overkill when there is a separate basil kit.<br /><br />With that said, the green basil grows really fast.  It was ready to harvest within three weeks.  The purple basil is the next best, followed by the mint and the oregano.<br /><br />The chives are the most delicate -- they dislodge and curl back into the sponge.  After more than a month of growing, I have two thin sporuts, not even enough for one potato.  My biggest disappointment was the cilantro --mine never sprouted.  I called the company and they shipped me a replacement, which also never sprouted.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new herb varieties to arrive in September.  I will be experimenting by mixing herbs from the various kits to get the combination I want.<br /><br />If you've ever tried to grow herbs indoors and not been happy with the results, this is the product for you.  It's very easy to take care of and the instructions are detailed and easy to understand.  It's unfortunate that some herbs work really well and others don't.<br /><br />Revised 10/13/06:  I spoke with someone in cusotmer service last week.  Aerogarden determined that the problem with the cilantro was that the water pump was too strong.  I was sent a free replacement pump.  When my new kits come in, I will try cilantro again.  The basil in this kit was wonderful.  The dill was fine and the oregano and mint were just okay in terms of growth and yield.  The chives were too delicate and the cilantro never worked.  Hopefully the new pump will fix the problem.<br /><br />The new kits will arrive next week.  The new Gourmet Herb kit replaces the oregano with parsley.<br /><br />Revised 11/21/06:<br />The cilantro in the new kit works beautifully!  I now give this kit four stars.",1

They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky.",1
1874,"Despite what some think there is a ton of fillers in here (see the ingredient list on the Omaha site), but.... that is not a bad thing in this case. They are not unhealthy fillers and these are very delicious. Our kids just love them. We serve one ball as a serving as that is the perfect healthy carb portion for a meal. 1 piece has the following nutrition just in case you are wondering:<br /><br />Calories: 120<br /><br />Fat: 4.5<br /><br />Trans Fat: 0<br /><br />Sodium: 270<br /><br />Carbohydrate: 17<br /><br />Protein: 3<br /><br />For our dinners we try to keep our carb side to under 5 fat & 25 carb. This fits perfectly & the taste is superb. Baked in the oven, they come out crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. All with no grease. We now keep these on hand instead of french fries. I know they cost more, but they taste better and they are so much healthier. We wait for one of the sales and buy several boxes at a time.",1
1875,"Our 16 month old yellow lab loves to play with empty 2 liter pop bottles.  I bought him this toy because I worried he would cut his mouth and gums on the sharp plastic shards of those flimsy bottles.  No worry about that with the Tug-a-Jug...this toy will most likely survive through the next millennium!<br /><br />To fill with treats,  just twist off the bottom;  couldn't be easier.  It's a lot of fun watching our dog figure out how to get at the goodies inside.<br /><br />I honestly don't think the rope pull is going to last very long;  especially if you are buying this for an aggressive chewer.  However,  don't let that stop you from buying the tug-a-jug.  Even without the rope,  it's still a great and challenging toy.",1
1876,"My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No ""doggie junk food"" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.",1
1877,"Even though I grew up with Bisquick and love it, we are always looking for new and different pancake mixes...so I was excited to see all the rave reviews on Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix Wheat-Free & Gluten Free (on Amazon). It wasn't until after I purchased it that I even noticed it was what-free and gluten-free.<br /><br />Well, let me just tell you, at least for pancakes, this stuff is NO Bisquick. Bisquick still beats Pamela's by a country mile (or six). I cannot fathom how other reviewers there likened this to Bisquick or even better than Bisquick. NO WAY, NO HOW!<br /><br />Now, the pancakes were certainly not BAD--and I could see how if your diet required you to eat wheat- or gluten-free, then the pancakes were probably even good. But to say they were better than Bisquick? Never. Bisquick pancakes cook up light and fluffy; Pamela's pancakes were too moist and dense and flat and didn't even cook like regular pancakes (they don't bubble up like normal pancake batter, so we were a bit confused how to cook them). We even tried a few different cooking methods (temperatures) and none came out any better.<br /><br />Can you tell I'm a Bisquick girl? :) Here, let me get it out of my system: Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick Bisquick.<br /><br />The bag says ""Makes waffles, scones, muffins, loaf cakes, cookies, biscuits, coffee cake, and more"" and there are recipes on the package for all of those, including a banana loaf cake, pumpkin loaf cake with nut topping, sour cream coffee cake, zucchini loaf cake, chocolate chip cookies, and (I kid you not) Bisquick-Type Drop Biscuits. :)<br /><br />I did make a batch of chocolate chip cookies with the mix and those were good--they didn't taste any different than regular cookies made with flour. But for the regular person (i.e. you don't NEED this type of product) then it's certainly more expensive than flour. I am definitely going to try a few of the other suggested recipes to use up the rest because we certainly aren't going to make pancakes with it.<br /><br />It is costly: $40 for three (3) 64oz bags (or $13.33 per bag). If you sign up for the ""Subscribe & Save"" it drops to $34, or $11.33/bag or 17c/oz. That sounded like a good deal at first, but a 64oz bag isn't nearly as big as I thought it was. Compared to (are you ready?) Bisquick, which I can get a 96oz box at Costco for about $9 or 9c/oz...it's almost double the price. So unless you NEED this, I wouldn't buy it.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Brown rice flour, white rice flour, cultured buttermilk, natural almond meal (may appear as brown flecks), tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, potato starch, grainless & aluminum-free baking powder (sodium bicarbonate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, potato starch), baking soda, sea salt, xantham gum<br /><br />ALLERGEN INFORMATION: CONTAINS TREE NUTS AND MILK<br /><br />*Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue & Autism Support, and Research Organizations, and is a member of the American Celiac Disease Alliance.<br /><br />I am giving the mix three stars out of five. If I needed the gluten-free aspect I would probably rate it much higher (at least 4 stars, if not 5). But as just your Average Joe looking for a pancake mix to replace Bisquick...or something to replace flour, I'd give this three stars and advise you to stick with Bisquick (or whatever product you currently use that you like).",0
1878,"Titanium Dioxide is a very common food additive which is used as a white pigment. It's naturally occurring and about 4 million tons are consumed per year worldwide. The only research on it as a possible carcinogen deal with it being INHALED (breathed in), not ingested (swallowed) in plants which manufacture it, where workers are exposed to hundreds of thousands of times more material than what exists in food.

1881,"First, the lack of enthusiasm for this product has nothing to do with it's quality.  Not only are Shirataki products by ""Miracle Noodle"" good quality but an excellent product if you are counting carbs or calories.  My only problem is with the form of the ""Rice""... it tastes and cooks up just fine but it really isn't a substitution for rice, it's texture and size are more akin to small pasta balls the size of peppercorns... (think Spetzle or Acini de Pepe) ((sp?))...<br /><br />Actually, the first thing I thought about when I cooked up my first batch was that they were slightly smaller versions of the tanslucent ""Bubbles"" that people seem to like to put in their iced tea and coffee drinks nowadays... (which in turn, remind me of little round gummy candies with no taste.)<br /><br />Shirataki noodles are an EXCELLENT no-cal/no-carb substitute for pasta... but if you are thinking that you're going to get anything like a ""rice"" substitute... I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you...  just go ahead and get the noodles.<br /><br />BTW.. the Miracle brand of Shirataki products are the lowest in Calories and Carbs that I have found but if you want something with just a couple more calories and only about 3-4 grams of carbs, you might want to try one of the shiritaki noodles out there that have tofu in them, they taste ""hardier"" and are much more like eating true pasta... I believe you can also get that type here at Amazon.com but, if not, you can normally get them at your local asian food store as well.",1

The quantity of the bag, 12 eggs was definitely 12 eggs, between 3 of us, we managed two breakfasts and plenty for soup.

It's not alone-- autolyzed yeast, corn-sourced maltodextrin (which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore), the list goes on, but in short they are all MSG... only unlike Europe, America does not require that special ""enhancer"" code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy (thanks, Monsanto).<br /><br />So that said, I did taste a bit of it, trusting his comment of no MSG (it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them)... and as I am sensitized to the weird not-salt flavor of it, I stopped and asked politely to see the package. Sure enough, glaring at me is MSG... For taste, I'd give it 3 stars overall--the MSG taste isn't super-strong, but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless, so I couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />For ethics, it's a miserly negative 10 stars...",0

Also, each pod has a handy paper ""tab"" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.

The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness.

1896,"I have tried 3 recipes, so far, & cannot say I am thrilled. The first was a quick bread that didn't rise & did scorch (not sure why.) When I cut off the scorched bits, I didn't much care for the flavor of the bread. Then I tried coconut muffins with chocolate chips & dried cherries. The recipes in the book I got rely HEAVILY on eggs, & the muffins proved to be rather heavy, with a pronounced eggy flavor. My third attempt was peanut butter cookies. Normal peanut butter cookies tend to disappear rather quickly around here, but these are loitering in the cookie jar. This may be an acceptable substitute for folks with wheat allergies (if the are not also allergic to eggs!), but so far, my family is unenthused.

1902,"This morning I reviewed 2 ORGANIC matcha teas, side by side:<br /><br />1.  The first one was: ""2nd harvest Organic Domatcha"" tea that I purchased at a local farmer's market, and I paid $37.99 for this 2.82 oz tin. Result = 4.5 stars (greatest taste and foam, organic, very expensive)<br /><br />2,  The second one was ""SerendipiTea matcha culinary grade organic green tea"" which I ordered on amazon.com, paying only $17.99 for a whopping 4 oz. bag. (twice as much for half the price).  Result = 5 stars (great taste, good foam, organic, terrific cost)<br /><br />**NOTE: see another review of SerendipiTea by me, beside 2 other brands.  It won in that review as well.<br /><br />I made the 2 cups identically, using soymilk and water 50/50, using the Blaney method (described below):<br /><br />""Blaney"" Method for making Green Tea Latte:<br />You need 2 small sauce pans on a gas stovetop, latte foamer device, bamboo whisk, soymilk, water, teaspoon measure, 翻 cup measuare, and matcha powder.  (many prefer sweetener and I suggest Agave syrup but I did not use it in this test since I enjoy the pure unsweetened tea flavor.  Cheaper teas may require the sweetener to mask any fishy tastes, but not these two high quality brands.)<br /><br />1. Using the latte foamer device, please foam 1/2 cup (cold or tepid) soymilk, then heat it gently while stirring (this personal ""Blaney"" method of mine makes the best foam)<br />2. heat 1/2 cup water (in separate pan) til boiling<br />3. add 1 level tsp matcha to 1/2 c. heated water and wisk with bamboo wisk about 30 seconds in zig zag motion  until matcha powder is dissolved<br />4. add the heated, foamed soymilk to the matcha/water blend<br />5. pour this mix into latte device, pump 20 or so times, then pour entire foamed mixture into large mug.<br /><br />For this test I made the two teas simultaneously so the `foamed' structure would be nearly identical (one is supposed to drink the latte immediately before the foam dissipates). I did, however, rinse the items with filtered water before pumping the second tea, so as to not to contaminate #2 with #1.<br /><br />For photo of the 2 teas and boxes, see:  [...]<br />Result:<br /><br />>>>Taste and texture:<br />DoMatcha won for a (very slightly, barely noticeable)  cleaner taste, and better 'foam'. However, the SerendipiTea was still very yummy.  I have the most sensitive taste buds on earth (other than my son) and I detected a very mild ""ocean"" taste with the Serindipitea, but I attribute that to the fact that my SerindipiTea had been opened a week prior.  The DoMatcha had only been opened the day before.  Newly opened teas always taste best. I would love to repeat this test in the future with two newly opened teas so that oxygen exposure won't be a variable as it was here.<br />&lt;&lt;&lt;Price:<br />Well, the DoMatcha 2nd harvest organic costs 4 times more, and is only ever-so-slightly better, and if I re-test with two new, unopened packages, who knows? Maybe they will be the same.<br /><br /> I am giving the SerendipiTea organic  5 stars for being such a cost bargain, being organic, and tasting so great...  and I am giving  the DoMatcha 4.5 stars for also being organic and tasting great, even fantastic, but being such a high cost.<br /><br />Carol Blaney, Ph.D.",1

I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell ""dog food"".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.",1

I put them into my fish tank, hoping they needed some water but they still didn't swim.  They just needed some water!  I am still trying to get them to breathe.  I am reading my Bible and praying religiously hoping they will rise from the dead.  Who would do such a thing?  Satan is at work here.  These fish were so cute and innocent!  They were probably used in shampoo-testing, I suspect because of the orange crumbs at the bottom of the box.",0

Some of the pieces seemed a bit stale and hard and the moonpie was basically crushed, though we've only eaten a few pieces so far.  You couldn't find this type of candy anywhere so it is a great concept to bring all of it back again in one box.  My biggest complaint was the ground shipping which was over priced in my opinion.  I'm not sure how long this company has been doing it but it appears they have some things to correct in order to succeed further.  I noticed too that the candy was all in a jumbled mess.  I'm not sure a woman would have organized the box in that same fashion.  So please try to correct these issues and I will buy from you again.  Thank you.",1

1916,"First time I have tried ghee - because I heard it was a delicious and high heat oil - and used it to stir fry napa cabbage.  Found the taste a little like lamb and or goats milk cheese - both of which I don't like.  I ended up throwing all of it out as I do not like the flavor of mutton or whatever the flavor was.  I don't know if all ghee tastes like this, or if I just got a brand that was off.  Others may love the flavor of lamb or goat - I found it very hard to take.  The actual frying heat was nice and high - although I did not fry it too high in my cast iron wok.<br /><br />I am now going to try other less flavorful oils, will try mac nut oil or something.",0

Some of the cookies and crackers had no taste to speak of and were only useful to scoop up the formaggio which wasn't remarkable.  Whoever sold this to you may want to rethink their source.  The basket is nice, however!""<br /><br />So much for a nice Father's day gift!",1
1920,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags. Most importantly, my two-year-old daughter (who is so picky she hardly eats anything) absolutely LOVES these chips.<br /><br />These chips are technically ""multigrain"" because they contain yellow corn, brown rice flour, flax seeds, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and soy flour. However, stone ground yellow corn is clearly the main ingredient in these chips and you'll have a hard time picking up the flavor of the other ingredients with your taste buds.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about these chips is that they're flavored with sea salt, which is lower in sodium and (in my opinion) tastes better than regular table salt. With only 140 calories per bag and 7 grams of fat it's hard not to say yes to this tasty treat.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend these chips!",1

It is very high in calories (20 per chew, and they recommend two chews at a time), and it is also high in salt (Sodium 15 mg per chew, 30 per recommended serving).  Salt is somthing cardiac patients are supposed to restrict, or at the least, limit.<br />I also noted an undesirable thick waxy coating left on the roof of my mouth.  The coating is tasteless (not the candy itself).  One other side-effect I noticed is constipation.",1

With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!

1925,"This is a nice quality cup and infuser -- it's sturdy and comfortable.  The infuser is resistant to staining and the little lid that is used to keep the heat in when steeping can be turned upside-down to act as a holder for the wet infuser when you remove it from the tea.<br /><br />However, there are some problems.  My main complaint is the design of the infuser.  The sides are a nice, fine mesh whereas the bottom is plastic with some perforations.  These holes in the bottom allow small leaf bits to flow-out.  I have a Teeli infuser that has the mesh in the bottom also and it keeps all of the leaves contained.  Second, and far more minor, the cup is rather small.  It makes a nicely sized cup of tea, but if you're used to drinking from larger cups and mugs, you will find yourself gulping this one down pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad product and if it had the full mesh infuser, I would have given it 4 stars.",1

1930,"This flour works fine for certain things, depending on your taste preferences.  It has a very strong aftertaste (kind of bitter/sour) because of the bean flour.  Thus it is pretty strong in plain breads and rolls.  If you don't mind that, then good for you!  (My husband is pretty sensitive and can't tolerate the bean flour or taste very well.)  I found it works better in cookies, chocolate or spice cakes, brownies, banana bread, and pizza dough.  Because these baked goods are made with other strong flavors, they help mellow out the bean taste which can be pretty overpowering if you don't have something with which to temper it.  I like the consistency of this flour better than the rice flour blend I've also been using but again, consider your taste preferences and what you'll be baking/cooking with it.",1

I tried rolling up the peas in an omlet and served it to my wife on our 75th anniversary. This was just my way of expressing my affection for her. Somehow she missed my sincere intentions and barfed all over my grandmother's antique quilt. Then our Irish Wolfhound jumped up on the bed, licked up the disgusting mess and yelped so loud that 3 of my goldfish jumped out of their bowl and were eaten by my cat. At least someone got a good meal from all my hard work.<br /><br />I had some small success passing out single peas to the neighborhood kids, telling them that they were a new flavor of M&Ms. Their parents really have no gripe with me, but I explained it all to the police. They could not find any violation of law, so I was released without charges.<br /><br />I did feel a bit ripped off by the 9.9 oz. packaging as I had expected a full 10 oz. bottle. After carefully counting all the peas I determined that 4 additional peas would make up the missing 1/10 ounce (yes, I did the math). So I called customer service, told them how unhappy I was and asked them to send me 4 additional peas. She was polite, but said no, claiming that they wouldn't have a pod to pea in. Whatever. These are really nice peas -- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",0

1935,"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,",0
1936,"This is one of the most versatile mixes I've found, and most recipes come out tasting very much like the Full of Gluten Blends. I, like many, am struggling with celiac's disease, and I've only just found out I have it, so I'm not quite sure what to buy, what's healthy, and what doesn't taste like cardboard.<br /><br />Gluten Free is a way of life you have to adjust to in almost every way, from giving up many favorites, to training your pallet to love these new found grains.<br /><br />Bisquick is Rice based, and is very much like it's original version, however be aware that the pancakes will be a little less fluffy and that you should follow the recipe to the T when it comes to these. Betty Crocker has a Recipe website they've published for you using this product that has quite a few tasty treats you'll love. When it calls for Vegetable Shortening, be sure to use it, for example, biscuits made without shortening, and only butter will be very dry and not very satisfying, even difficult to swallow. Use recipes that include shortening, and will result in moist, fluffy foods and breads will help you end up with an enjoyable addition to your meal.<br /><br />Fun and Tasty Gluten Free Recipes for this mix can be found on the Betty Crocker website, they won't allow me to post the link here, sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE: ** Fun Tip about this and other Gluten Free Mixes, My mom Figured out that when you're mixing together your ingredients and you're using one that calls for milk, that if you mix together ONLY the BASE MIX and the MILK and let it set for about 15 minutes before continuing with your recipe and adding other ingredients, the end result is much fluffier and tastier **  This would be much like making tapioca pudding, you have to let the milk and tapioca soak to 'activate the tapioca' before moving on, so I think that type of reaction is what's happening here with the Bisquick Mix. YAY for Mom!<br /><br />Hope that helps you with your purchasing decision.<br />Thanks for reading!",1

Have you ever seen something that is so symbolic that you are transported back in mind?

You aren't 10 anymore. If you buy this for someone else, you will be highly tempted to devour the entire basket or slyly sneak out a few select choices.  There are several other sets in this product line, each with their own unique line-up, my favorite being the 70's box. Enjoy!",1

I wanted to try the 5 hour energy because the ""Go Girls"" kept me up at night.<br /><br />First of all, I understand first hand that this drink affects people differently. Like I said my Dad loves it and swears by it, myself, not so much.<br /><br />I decided to drink only half the bottle to start with, so it wouldn't be too overwhelming. But, even with half the bottle it really messed me up.<br /><br />I felt tired but my heart wouldn't stop racing. It was pounding so much, like I just ran 10 miles in record time! The rest of my body felt awful too. My arms were jittery, yet kinda numb. My legs felt like spaghetti and my stomach felt like it was in knots. Andy even though my body felt like it was all amped up I still felt exhausted and needed to keep putting my head down. I also felt like I just wanted to have a meltdown and cry. It was awful!<br /><br />Be careful if you try this. Take a little bit at a time. For the first time take it when you don't need to do anything or go anywhere. Like I said everyone reacts differently to it. My Dad has these like 2 or 3 times a week and loves it. So try it for yourself, but this was my experience.",1

1944,"As most of you probably are, I was a bit skeptical while placing my order for this Wheat Grass Powder. Instant wheat grass sounds both unappetizing and not especially nutritional. Well, as is my nature, I did needless amounts of research on the effectiveness of powdered wheat grass, and found several articles with very mixed answers, so I decided to give it a shot and decide for myself.<br /><br />My first impression was that this stuff was disgusting. While fresh wheat grass bought at a health store smells like a freshly cut golf course, this stuff smells like a barn. I held my breath and mixed the recommended amount of the dark green powder with a glass of ice water and chugged. I couldn't get 1/4 way through with the mixture before I gagged and decided I would never drink the stuff with water again. The label recommends drinking it with a juice, particularly orange juice, so that's what I did the second time around. If you mix it with a strong enough flavored juice, it is actually quite enjoyable. The nasty taste is barely detectable, and all you are left to put up with is the smell. Currently my favorite juices to mix it with are stronger flavored juices mixed with multiple types of fruits - anything with grapefruit juice works great. On to the effects.<br /><br />When I down a shot of fresh wheat grass, I get a small boost of energy - but most importantly I maintain a healthy up-beat feeling throughout the day. The result is more of a lack of fatigue than an elevation in energy. With this powdered wheat grass, I get the same effect, simply on a lesser scale. The initial boost of energy is barely noticeable, but I am able to maintain that same ""healthy feeling"" that I get with the fresh wheat grass. And the nutritional value is all there: both the vitamins and chlorophyll (see table below). The final test, which I plan on conducting: The Hangover Test. A shot of wheat grass will get me out of that half-asleep feeling I get after a night of heavy South Florida binge drinking, so it is only natural that I test the effects of the powdered wheat grass on a hangover. While I am tempted to drink solely for the sake of this review, for now I must wait - I will update with results asap.<br /><br />Nutritional comparison of generic wheat grass powder to fresh wheat grass.

1951,"It took me a decade of yo-yo dieting on various plans, four short-term successes, and now, hopefully, a long-term success is on the way. I have lost 35 lbs in 6 months, and going strong. I lost it gradually and within recommended weight loss recommendations (1-2 lbs a week). I didn't starve myself, stop my social life for any diet's decrees, and I definitely wasn't under the tutelage of any one diet. I have done that already and realize a few things: 1) you must exercise daily, 2) you must mind calories, 3) you must eat 3 meals and 2 snacks every day, and 4) the types of nutrients matter (omega 3, 6, and 9 fats, thermogenic herbs, antioxidants, etc.)<br /><br />The greatest myth I busted was any form of perfectionism. If you have a candy bar once in a while, that doesn't mean you are a big failure, you have to start all over, and you might as well do that next week (so you can binge in the meantime).<br /><br />All diets are perfectionistic. They focus on one aspect of healthy eating and run with it to fit the lose-weight-overnight / Can-I-also-have-a-pizza-with-all-the-fixings? mentality of the typical deluded American. That's why we have the Atkins diet, illustrating the worst of this concept. However, these diets aren't bad, because you can extract a jewel of knowledge from each of these regimens. Atkins taught us to watch carbs and not to fear protein (although that doesn't mean you can eat bacon); Fat Flush teaches you the difference between good and bad fats, thermogenic herbs (that raise the metabolism), and a very basic understanding of the Glycemic Index, and Thurmond teaches you what combinations of foods work to lose weight and the power of eating many small meals throughout the day.<br /><br />Larabar is another great example of the focused diet. The jewel is the omega fats 3 and 6, gluten-free, no dietary sweeteners (which increase your appetite and studies have correlated artificial sweeteners to weight gain because of its high glycemic index count), and it being all natural, organic, and kosher. That's great, when you focus on only this aspect. But still, however popular diets have become, Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and the like can never be ignored. The one irrefutable truth is the calories you take in determine what your weight will be in the immediate future. If there is a high fat percentage, which are calories still, you have to consider that.<br /><br />LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES! These health bars are healthy, but I would only have them as a reward before or after a good workout. This is the first review that I am rating this low because of the padding I suspect going on. One reviewer talks about the low calories, which is totally false. Two reviewers talk about how healthy it is, sounding very close to an infomercial as he focuses on only one aspect but ignores another. The suspicion arises when these two reviewers rate this bar 5 STARS 3-4 FREAKIN' TIMES WITH THE SAME WORDS! They must mention the excessive calories and fat in these bars, or else someone's going to go off of insufficient information and eat one every day with a sedentary lifestyle. Compare this bar to a Snickers, and you may have a different perspective. What is labeled ""healthy"" can be very bias.<br /><br />MY POINT BEYOND LARABARS: You can't focus on one system of ideas, because health and nutrition and weight loss are much larger and much more demanding concepts of nature's effect on the body. It's how you sustain and develop habits and balance in life, and it's about the knowledge you keep in your head, so you can deftly cut corners through increasing your metabolism or burning the maximum calories. It's about myth busting. It's about making smart choices. It's about knowing what choices are in the first place; if you choose one path, you can't choose another. Sacrifices may be what your particular body requires to be healthy and lose weight. You won't find a real chili-dog diet. You won't find a sugar that tastes exactly like sugar. One path leads to one place, while the other path leads to another. Note the difference, and be realistic.<br /><br />Lastly, the only health change you can make overnight happens in your head, not in your body.",0

1955,"MY QUESTION FOLLOWED BY THEIR REPLY - VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!<br /><br />Hey guys,<br />So we are trying to feed a new born as much breast milk as we can, however there is not enough to meet his nutritional needs.<br />So a formula is in order as a supplement. With that, we are interested in your toddler formula, and it appears that since this meets the FDA Infant Formula Guidelines, that it should be safe, (and opinions on the Internet seem to feel the same way). However, our doctor says that it should not be used because of the higher amounts of calcium and phosphorous. He was also concerned about using the DHA/ARA supplement with concerns about the egg white process and that the proteins in egg whites are not good for an infant. Any thoughts on this? Thanks!<br /><br />THEIR ANSWER<br /><br />Dear Dave,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Nature's One簧.  Firstly, you are correct in that our Baby's Only Organic簧 formulas meet the nutritional requirements of the FDA's Infant Formula Act. No dilution is needed for babies under 12 months of age. Please follow label mixing instructions.<br /><br />Regarding the calcium and phosphorous content in Baby's Only Organic簧 formulas, calcium is an essential nutrient needed for bone health. The American Academy of Pediatrics Expert Panel for Nutrient Levels in Infant Formula has provided recommendations on the amount of calcium with the minimum per 100 Calories being 50 milligrams and the maximum being 140 milligrams per 100 Calories. Phosphorus is another important mineral for bone health. The Expert Panel has also recommended that the calcium to phosphorus ratio in an infant formula be no less than 1.1 or more than 2.0. Baby's Only Organic簧 falls within these ranges with our calcium at 135 milligrams per 100 Calories and a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.5.<br />Reference: Committee on Nutrition, Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, The American Academy of Pediatrics, 2009, pages 1245-1246.<br /><br />The balance between calcium and phosphorus is most important for bone development. The calcium to phosphorus ratio in both Baby's Only Organic簧 formula and Enfamil NextStep is 1:5. Thus, Baby's Only Organic簧 formulas provide an appropriate ratio of calcium and phosphorus for toddlers and an appropriate overall quantity of calcium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Regarding our Baby's Only Essentials簧 DHA/ARA supplement, The DHA utilized in our Baby's Only Essentials簧 DHA & ARA supplement is sourced from egg yolk phospholipids. You are probably aware that most often an egg allergy is caused by the egg white rather than the yolk. Additionally, it is the protein component of foods that usually elicit an allergic reaction. Because we use the phospholipids (not protein) from the egg yolk, there is only a very minute chance that an allergic response will ensue.<br /><br />If your child has a history of allergies, we highly recommend that you consult your child's healthcare provider.<br /><br />DHA is also found naturally in other foods, including oily fish like trout, sardines, tuna and salmon and the yolk of eggs. Dietary ARA is available from animal meats, dairy foods, eggs, peanuts and nori seaweed. As your child increases the variety of foods in her diet, you can include some of these foods in her diet. Other natural sources of DHA would include fish oil or fish oil supplements. Unfortunately, it is difficult to insure that these are free from mercury or other environmental toxins. But, also remember that these fatty acids can be formed from dietary linoleic and linolenic acids (nuts, seeds, grains legumes, vegetables and their cold-pressed oils). By including good sources of high quality fats in the diet, your child will easily be able to meet her specific needs<br /><br />Most egg allergies are a result of ingestion of egg white; egg yolk allergies are rare.<br /><br />Proteins are the component of foods that cause allergic reactions. Egg allergy is usually due to the proteins in the egg white. These protein allergens are: ovomucoid, ovalbumin, ovotransferrin; lysozyme, and ovomucin.<br /><br />However, there can be a rare situation of egg yolk allergy. The literature to date usually associates egg yolk allergy to a reaction triggered by inhaled bird allergen, referred to as Bird-egg syndrome. This is a very rare syndrome.<br /><br />Egg allergy can also be seasonal. Oak pollen, short and western ragweed and the goosefoot family of weeds may cross react with eggs when these pollens are in season.<br /><br />The estimated point prevalence of egg allergy in children is 1.6% by 2.5 years of age. (1) Again, egg white is usually the cause of an egg allergy. Most children outgrow an allergy to eggs by 5 years of age.<br /><br /> (1) Eggesbo M, Botten G, Halvorsen R, Magnus P, ""The prevalence of allergy to egg: a population-based study in young children,"" Allergy 56; 5:403<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful to you. Thank you for your interest in Baby's Only Organic簧 formulas. Please let me know if you have additional questions.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Lori<br />Nature's One Inc.<br />[...]<br />[...]<br />Toll Free [...]",1
1956,"I was disappointed in the packaging as the Oats were in a simple plastic bag that was overfilled and a plain cardboard box that barely held together.

1957,"Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.",1

My order did not ship out for a week, after I sent them an email asking if they had shipped my products yet. I got them today and the whole box of food items that I ordered smells like cigerettes. I thought at first maybe it was the UPS driver but the inside of the cookbook smells like smoke so I am guessing it is at the farm not the driver. Also, the dough enhancer was not at all similar to a different product that I have been using for over a year but there were not ingredients list so I could not compare. I say buyer beware.",1

1962,"They're for eating, of course (ok, maybe if you're an oat farmer, you have a different persepctive.)  At any rate, rather than argue the relative virtues of rolled vs. steel cut oat cereals, I sing the praises of both.  Maybe it's a seasonal thing, the somewhat coarser, nuttier, rougher steel cuts somehow more fitting to cold winters than are the mellower and softer rolled oats.  It's like black coffee to an au lait, dark beer to light, hard bebop to cool jazz...you get the picture.<br /><br />You'll also feel virtuous spending some old-fashioned time over the stove (albeit not that much, or that arduous).  The warming experience is itself sufficient, you'll feel like mending a fence somewhere (or tearing it down if in a RObert Frost frame of mind), but it's common to top this<br /><br />with contrasting fruit, or perhaps nuts, syrups, flax seed oil, brown sugar, yoghurt, raisins, prunes, lat night's stew?--it's HEARTY enough to stand up to almost anything you can throw at it.

1963,"I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.",1

It's not as good as the butter chicken paste is, nor does it smell as good. This chicken curry paste is also VERY salty; I had to add more rice and vegetables to my bowl because I couldn't handle the salt. The flavor is strong, though not spicy, and I think that the butter chicken is much more balanced in terms of spices and flavor and I wish that I had purchased that instead.<br /><br />Still, this is easy and quick to prepare and while it doesn't taste great it's still decent, which warrants its 3 stars.",1
1966,"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it.

Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change.

1967,"After much anticipation I ordered the three main Jamon Ham products:  Iberico de Bellota, Iberico de Bellota Paleta, & Jamon Serrano.<br /><br />Being used to Proscuitto (Parma) and loving it by itself and in many dishes, I had high expectations.  If you haven't had good proscuitto, then there isn't really anything to compare the Jamon product to.  The chopped stuff at your everyday grocery store is good for a little salty proscuitto like flavor in dishes but not for slices just to enjoy.<br /><br />I understand why people think Jamon is awesome, but the melting in your mouth with extreme grease/fat over your lips and fingers really sets home the fat content more than that Kobe Beef flavor burst and easier swallow.<br /><br />In the high end Jamon, you can really taste the acorns in the meat.  The nuttiness really comes through and it is very good.  The Iberico Paleta -> you don't get the nuttiness and it's a little tougher.  The Serrano really has much more meat and I preferred the flavor profile on it more than the other two.<br /><br />While I would rate the Iberico Bellato around 4 out of 5 stars (minus 1 for the heavy greasy feeling and fat), the price is ridiculous.  I would say it would be appropriately priced around $15-25/pound.  Given that is 4-6x lower than it's actual price, I had to take at least 2 stars from the product.<br /><br />You're better off with the SM Proscuitto.

1971,"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.",0

I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!  It's also an excellent value - Try Canidae, you'll see!",1

The cost is honestly too steep for me to buy other better rated matcha for the flavor, so I'm happy I can get this much tea for the price (I've got 3 kids & a lot of other priorities; maybe when I retire...). And for the price, I'm getting all the health benefits of any other matcha (you get all the antioxidants out of matcha since you ingest the whole leaf; brewing teas often makes the extracted antioxidants bitter), plus I don't feel too guilty using it on my face, either. Perfectly nice matcha for the beginner & the frugal. Gave some to my sister, also a novice to matcha, & she loved it too. Worth a try for the price.",1
1976,"My husband and I have raised honey bees for years, though we cannot call our honey organic because we live in an area where other farmers use chemicals which our bees may bring home to the hive unintentionally.  This honey is the most delicious honey I have ever tasted!!  We did have one time when we raised bees in Southern Illinois in a large clover field that was close to this good, maybe even as good though flavor somewhat different.  YS Royal Honey is so good it was hard to not eat too much.  We should all practice temperance in eating, even if it is something that is ""good for you.""  Although the price is high, consider it like gourmet candy. Because it is not heated to high temperatures in processing, it crystallizes much quicker than more refined honey products.  But, it can easily be liquefied by placing the jar in a pan of hot water (not on the stove).  If you put it in the microwave to soften it, you will kill some of the beneficial elements in the honey.  Microwave ovens are great for heating water, but must be used at low power levels for short periods of time if you want to maintain the beneficial micro-nutrients in your food!  Also, research has shown that if you use plastic containers in the microwave, chemicals are released from the plastic which are then absorbed by the food.  The chemicals accumulate in your body and can eventually lead to cancer.  Use glass or ceramic only in the microwave because they do not release any harmful chemicals when used in the microwave!!!!",1

I used this as intended with the splatter shield, and ran it through multiple de-scalings by using vinegar/water, and the mold did not go away- except some gets into the food basket each time you steam! So, your baby is eating his/her food with mold in it. The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy.

1980,"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies.",0

1989,"Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason.

I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]",1
1990,"I have been enjoying & purchasing Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Multibran Cereal for over a year.

1991,"I really love this product.  It came pretty fast and well packaged.  It's 100% pure Cocoa Butter so it has a wonderful faint chocolate smell, its hard, and a little waxy to the touch.  However, it works wonders for the skin if you know how to use it. I know some people had a hard time trying to figure out how to use it so I have provided some instructions if you want to try it.<br /><br />~First remove the chucks from the container and melt it down in a pot over a low flame.  Once the chucks of Cocoa Butter are completely melted turn the flame off to avoid the oil becoming too hot and popping.  Infuse with your favorite oil, just make sure it's all natural like i.e. ""grape seed oil"", ""emu oil"", or an ""olive oil"".  Pure in about 3/4 to 1/2 a cup of the oil with the melted Cocoa Butter.  Mix it in then put the mixture into a plastic container with a lid and put it in freezer over night.  In the morning you will have a softer more usable product the melts when you rub it in your hands.  Use it for your heals, knees, elbows, or all over for soft conditioned skin.  It absorbs fast and leaves your skin completely moisturized it's great for blending or fading dark spot and healing of stretch marks.  Enjoy!",1

1993,"This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via ""Subscribe & Save"" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.

But this guy sells this coffee for 22.50 for ONE!!!!! box of coffee.When it arrived at my house I asked my wife where the other box was and she said: ""Thats It just one box arrived!"" I looked my order over and sure enough he does sell it for 1 box of coffee for 22.50 making this probably the MOST expensive k-cup coffee on Amazon. So shame on me for not looking the order over before I purchased it. If you look at all the other sellers, their coffee is 23.00 for TWO BOXES OF 25 count k-cups. Thats 50 k-cups. This guy only gives you 25 k-cups for 22.50 which is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!! congratulations you fooled me, but I hope this review warns others off.",1
1996,"I purchased a burrito from a small shop a few blocks from home. I was unimpressed with their habanero ""hot"" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.<br /><br />I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of ""Insanity++."" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.<br /><br />I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals.",1

I take these with me for breakfast or a snack to classes, and it helps fight off any hunger while I get some protein.  I've also found that it is more filling if I drink it with something (juice or a bottle of water) and can make a quick meal.

2001,"This is a tasty sweet-ginger curry with chick peas and a few chunks of potato. The sweetness comes from the chick peas themselves, smartly brought out by the spices chosen.  The texture of the vegetables is surprisingly good - modestly firm, not an unrecognizable mush.  Unlike most prepackaged meals, I don't mind it cold, though it only takes two minutes in the microwave.<br /><br />Each package has 480 calories, which is rather incredible for just 10 ounces of Indian food with no ghee or paneer.  In fairness, it is high in fiber and protein and low in bad fats, so it is probably an ideal choice for skinny vegans/vegetarians.  But for those like me that eat plenty of dairy and meat but are trying to keep a few meals light but flavorful and filling, there are better options, particularly the Dal Bukara (340 calories) and Rajma Masala (270) by the same maker and several options from MTR or Tasty Bite.<br /><br />ETA: I understand it's technically 2.3 servings, but my original review was geared in terms of a quick office lunch, which is how I most often consume shelf-stable foods like this.  For me (tall male), 10 ounces of food is about what I expect for lunch.  So I still eat this, but usually as an addition to a family meal with a couple of other dishes and rice.  In that context, I full endorse the recommendation of other commenters to heat with a can of regular chickpeas (drained), ideally after sauteing a bit of garlic or onion.  The flavor spreads nicely, plus it's a bit healthier and cheaper that way.",1

Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods.

2003,"I was looking for an egg powder to use in protein shakes and stumbled across this. Upon examining the ingredients, I realized this product was not for me--nor probably many others. This product contains soy, which, in the last 20 years, has been added to virtually everything because it is a cheap filler. At one time, we were told soy had a long list of wonderful benefits and people were gobbling up soy milk and everything else soy they could get their hands on thinking it was a real health benefit.<br /><br />However, the tide has turned and the medical community now realizes that all this excess soy (which soy contains ALOT of phytoestrogens!) is not good for everyone. Estrogens increase many kinds of cancers and if you are overweight, body fat produces and stores excess estrogen on its own, so this is only adding to the problem for both men and women. Perimenopausal women also often suffer from estrogen dominance (you know if you have fibroids) and, therefore, make soy a poor choice.<br /><br />Some people believe phytoestrogens can ""balance out"" cyclic changes of low and high estrogens, but this has not been proven (while the effects of too much soy has) and for me, I'd rather err on the side of caution. Especially considering there is hidden soy in almost everything we buy prepackaged, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens from other plant sources.<br /><br />While I love Bob's Red Mill products, basically soy anything should only be consumed in small doses and using products like this regularly should be carefully considered.",0

2006,"I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the ""Whole Rabbit"" from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.<br /><br />The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.<br /><br />There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).<br /><br />I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me?

2010,"If you follow the supplied directions, you'll get an active sourdough starter within days; however, keep in mind that not all sourdough is sour, so you'll have to take some extra steps to get the San Francisco tang.  I bought this culture to add to my existing sourdough starter (which IS sour) to make the flavor more complex but ended up instead keeping two separate starters, simply because this one is so good.  Newcomers to sourdough may be disappointed with the taste until they learn the proper techniques to achieve the type of bread flavor they want.<br /><br />To begin, ""sourdough"" refers not to the taste, but to the method, which uses wild yeast and bacteria to create a sponge to be used in place of commercial yeast.  This culture will do exactly that.  In three days, I had such an active starter that my bread rose quickly, even in a winter-temperature house.  The bread was creamy, with an excellent crumb, although, because the starter was brand new, it tasted like white bread with a little character, something I expected but which may surprise beginners.  This was my first test of the starter to make sure it worked properly.  And it did.  Perfectly.  If you are buying this starter as a natural leavening agent and not as a sour bread maker, then skip to the last two paragraphs of this review.<br /><br />Most people who consider buying this culture will want their bread to taste sour, as it does in San Francisco.  They are not looking for a yeast substitute.  If this describes you, read on.<br /><br />San Francisco sourdough bread, with its distinctive tang, requires certain steps to enhance yeast- and bacteria-based fermentation. Here are my tips for creating a more ""sour"" taste using this culture:  1. When keeping the starter at room temperature, feed it less frequently once it has become established.  The instructions suggest feeding once every 12 hours (two feedings a day), but I find that once every 24 hours creates a more sour tasting starter.  2. Leaving the starter in the refrigerator for a week, unfed, and then pulling it back out for one feeding, then a sponge feeding 24 hours later, improves the sourness.  3. The instructions tell you to throw out all but 1/4 cup between feedings or to use 1/4 cup from your refrigerated starter.  I keep/use at least one cup, sometimes two, and give it the same amount of ""food"" -- 1/2 cup water and slightly less than 1 cup flour.  Just make sure that the final sponge is rising correctly before you use it. Once you get to know your starter, you'll know how much food and time it needs to fully activate.  4. Allow the shaped loaves to rise in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours to allow for more fermentation.  As the yeast and bacteria consume the available nutrients, the dough will get sticky from the alcohol by-products, so don't expect to handle it again.  5. If you are using a bread machine to knead the dough, use the French bread setting since that will lengthen the kneading/rising time, OR, if you are kneading by hand or mixer, complete two full risings.  6. Hot sourdough always tastes less sour than it will at room temperature.  Yes, it's difficult not to cut into the loaf right away, but try to let it cool to warm before serving.  If you always eat the bread hot out of the oven, without having leftovers, then you'll never taste the full tang.  7. If you only care about the tang and not about the rising power, check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155832156X"">The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook</a>.  Hensperger provides several recipes for starters and bread that are much cheaper than buying this culture.  The recipes use a combination of starter and commercial yeast, but they yield a nice sour bread.<br /><br />The key to sour bread is fermentation, so anything you can do to promote it will enhance the tang.  This includes stirring any hooch, or alcohol, back into the starter.<br /><br />Other tips for this culture:  never use chlorinated water and never store in a metal container.  I don't even use metal utensils, although this is probably overkill.  Supposedly, metal can both inhibit growth and discolor the starter.  Since sourdough starters improve over time, you can expect the flavor to improve with every passing week, provided that you care for it.  If you follow the instructions, you will have a thick starter, not as thick as a dough starter but not as liquid as a batter type.  Of course, you can make this into either type with different flour/water ratios.<br /><br />This starter arrives in dried, powdered form in a small packet.  It comes with can't-fail directions for reactivating and maintaining the starter.  You will need non-chlorinated water, unbleached flour, and a glass or plastic container that holds at least four cups.  (I use a glass Pyrex measuring cup so I can tell exactly how much starter I have.)  Plan on at least five days between first feeding and first loaf because you will need a highly active starter to properly leaven the bread.  You can revert to the 24-hour feedings once the starter rises substantially in the container.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently read that the lactobacillus part of the starter is what gives sourdough its tang.  The wild yeast gives the bread its rise and spring.  Lactobacilli thrive in colder temperatures (under 50 degrees F), so refrigeration may be essential to getting that sour taste, either during storage or rising. (Think of the average temperature of San Francisco!)  If you are using the starter for the first time or without storing it in the refrigerator, I highly recommend that you refrigerate the formed loaves overnight, then bring them up to room temperature for an hour or so before baking.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",1
2011,"I have a 8.5 month old Aussie mix. She's about 42 lbs now. This food is magic!! I love it! She's never been ""food motivated"" and so she's always been a little reluctant to eat her kibble, but she honestly LIKES this stuff. She'll do tricks for it like it is a treat. More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend.<br /><br />We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen.<br /><br />Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients.

2020,"I love ""Food for Life Ezekiel"" products. Originally, I was introduced to the bread when on a special diet -- an offshoot program of ""Over-eaters Anonymous"", the H.O.W. program -- many years ago. The bread contains NO flour, no sugar, is high in protein and fiber, and, for my taste, is delicious. Actually, I learned that OVER-eating was not really my problem. My problem was NOT eating the healthiest, life-giving, minimally processed foods available. Over time, I learned, relapsed, and relearned, etc. I was thrilled when I learned ""Food for Life"" added cereals to their product line. In looking at labels at my local health food store, I discovered that this brand was the ONLY cold cereal on the shelves that had NO sugar content! Since then, this is the ONLY cold cereal I buy. It can be served warm, as well. Generally, though, I prefer ""John McCann's Steel-Cut Irish Oatmeal"" (also zero sugar and high fiber) for hot cereal.<br /><br />Needless to say, the cereal is expensive (but cheap if you consider that you're no longer polluting your body with all the sugar, air, preservatives, and other junk in most commercial cereals), so I was thrilled to find that Amazon.com offered it in a 6-box bundle for a far better price than my local market. I usually have a bowl a day with fresh berries (strawberries are very sweet this year in my area) and slivered almonds topped with light soy milk.

2026,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.

What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product ""Wheat Free""?

More accurately, basic grocery store pepper flavor-wise is like the decaf instant coffee of the world, and these peppercorns are like a fresh roast from a favorite coffee shop - their quality is so different they're incomparable, one an unflattering caricature of the other.

2038,"We breastfeed our month old boy, but since his bilirubin level was still high, doctors recommended to switch to formula for 48 hours. We started with Similac Advance (Shield Plus) which we still had from hospital. First 24 hours were wonderful in terms of pooping, then we decided to switch to Similac Organic for known reasons, but during the first 32-Ounce Bottle I began to notice that his stool was getting harder, and eventually he stopped pooing (actually he produced two stone-ball like poops) and had a hard time for another 24 hours. Breast milk and Similac advance tested similarly sweet, but Similac Organic was much much less sweet. I made a research on the internet and I found the following that may help you to understand the cause of constipation: (http://www.drhull.com/EncyMaster/C/constipation_infant.html)<br /><br />Constipation means infrequent, hard stools. It does not mean grunting or straining, although your baby may certainly exhibit these behaviors when having a bowel movement. So the first question to ask is, ""Is my child really constipated?""<br /><br />Next, consider why true constipation - excessively hard, dry stools - arises. The normal function of the colon is to remove water from the stool. Otherwise we would rapidly dehydrate and die. That is why severe diarrhea is dangerous - the stool is moving through the colon and being expelled from the body so fast, there is no time to properly reabsorb the stool water back into the bloodstream.<br /><br />Conversely, if the fecal material remains in the colon too long, the water removal process may extract too much of the fecal water and leave the stool mass excessively dry and hard. It is just that simple.<br /><br />So constipation arises when feces remain in the colon too long because:<br /><br />  * the colon is naturally sluggish (has decreased ""motility,"" we say)<br />  * a low residue diet produces insufficient stimulation to the colon to trigger its normal propulsive activity and clear out the feces<br />  * a combination of the above two factors<br />  * there is obstruction of the lower GI tract<br />  o functional neurologic - the lower rectum and anus cannot properly relax to allow evacuation - Hirschprung disease<br />  o functional anatomic - anal-rectal positioning doesn't allow easy evacuation<br />  o mechanical - a tumor physically blocks stool passage<br /><br />Breast fed babies are essentially never truly constipated. This is because breast milk is such a low residue diet. Almost all of the milk is absorbed by the baby and used. The stools consist of a small amount of unabsorbed protein curds and a large amount of bowel secretions, chiefly mucus. And of course a lot of noisy gas. But these infrequent stools do not indicate constipation - just infrequent stools.<br /><br />Later, when breast feeding infants start solids, they technically can become constipated, but it is unusual in my experience. It is not until the child is pretty much on solids and especially when weaned to whole cow milk that constipation is much of an issue. By then we are really discussing toddlers.<br /><br />Breast fed infants do tend to save up after the first few months and poop less often. This worries some parents. Despite reassurances to the contrary, some folks just have to see a poop every day from their little darling to be happy and fulfilled. Go figure. They forget that stool can stay in the colon for a very, very long time and it will not hurt anything.<br /><br />When the stool hoarding breast feeder does finally get ready to go, another problem comes to the fore: grunting and straining. When the baby's rectum forms in utero, it is in a state of permanent contraction for nigh onto nine months. The baby does not pass the meconium (fetal stool) in utero until perhaps right at the end of gestation right before, during or after delivery. Until the baby is several months old, and has passed and been stretched by quite a few bowel movements, the rectum and particularly the anus may be quite tight and resist easy dilation to allow the stool to pass. Because the baby has weak, flabby abdominal musculature (that is why his little tummy is so poochy), he must push against this tight anal spincter with his diaphragm. Just as Mom pushed during delivery, and with seemingly equal discomfort. Hence the grunting and red-faced straining.<br /><br />  The other major problem of both breast or bottle fed newborns which creates this sort of straining is dyschezia, or uncoordinated stooling.<br /><br />The cure for the problem of a tight anus is pretty simple: a gentle rectal exam with a well-lubricated pinky finger by the doctor (which should be done on all babies with stooling troubles anyway to rule out a physical obstruction) will be both diagnostic and curative. If one such gentle dilation doesn't do the trick, I have Mom bring the baby back in a week and repeat the procedure. The anal spincter is stretched, and pretty soon, no more terrible straining.<br />Top<br /><br />Bottle fed infants are ""a whole 'nother story."" Infant formulas are not nearly as well digested as breast milk, and leave quite a bit more residue in the colon. (The exception to this rule in my mind is the new Similac簧 that really does seem to leave the stools about the same consistency as breast milk.) So true constipation in bottle fed infants is much more common; my feeling is that soy formulas are even worse than cow milk based formulas in this regard.<br /><br />The young infant's colon is simply not designed for all the residue and stool bulk. The residue builds up, is dried too much, and becomes hard, pebbly stool. It is naturally difficult and uncomfortable for the baby to pass.<br /><br />The addition of cereal to the diet only compounds whatever problems already exist. Cereal + milk = concrete. Cereal in the formula bottle seems to be especially bad, probably because parents don't realise just how much cereal the baby is getting.<br />Top<br /><br />Treatment of constipation mainly involves common sense diet modifications and sometimes medication:<br /><br />  * Again, as with breast fed babies, a search for the cause of the constipation and gentle rectal exam can work wonders.<br />  * I use a lot of Karo簧 corn syrup for bottle feeders with constipation. It is my first choice recomendation; it almost always works if used properly. Unfortunately, many doctors and nurses don't use it properly, get poor results, and don't recommend it as often as they should. I start with two measuring teaspoons in every formula bottle, regardless of size, and adjust the dose up or down depending on how things are going. Usually, the baby can be weaned off the Karo pretty soon, but may need to stay on it periodically for the first few months of life. It is very important to put the corn syrup in the formula and not give it in between in water. The excess corn syrup does not get digested very well - the baby is already digesting all the sugar he can from the formula. The excess sugar passes down to the colon and produces a sugar diarrhea similar to sorbitol (as below, prunes, apple juice).<br /><br />  Before scolding me about ""the risk of botulism"" from corn syrup, please see:<br /><br />  Clinical Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Volume 4,Number 3,September 2003: ""Pediatric neurologic potpourri: cases to remember""<br /><br />  ""In the past, C. botulinum was also found in corn syrup, but this is no longer a risk factor for infant botulism because of a recent change in the processing formula.""<br /><br />  For the complete source of statement, see: Olsen SJ, Swerdlow DL. Risk of infant botulism from corn syrup. In reply. Pediatr Infect Dis J 2000;19:584-5.<br /><br />  * Certain fruits and juices - for example prunes, apple juice, apricots - are rich in sorbitol, a nondigestible sugar that passes through the body to the colon and causes water to be retained or drawn into the stool mass. They can be increased in the diet to loosen the stool and relieve or prevent constipation.<br />  * Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar product that is processed by colon bacteria to produce an inflow of water into the stool mass. We use it a lot - it seems to be a favorite of our local pediatric gastroenterologists. The dose is adjusted up or down according to respose. Side effects are usually not serious but can include cramping or diarrhea - obviously, stop the medicine and call your doctor if these occur.<br />  * Glycerine suppositories are helpful to relieve your child if there is some hard stool that just won't come out easily. The suppository melts in the heat of the rectum and lubricates the stool. Glycerine also has a mild effect of attracting water into the stool, which softens it. The act of insertion also serves to stimulate the rectum and anus to initiate the defecation reflex. (Glycerine is completely safe - it is a food, found in candy, not a drug.)<br />  * Fiber containing foods are helpful for older children and adults, but are not really of much use in the treatment of young infant constipation, for dietary reasons: babies just don't eat a lot of fiber. (I believe ISoyalac簧, which was a high fiber soy formula, has been discontinued. It was never very available any place I practiced, anyway.)<br /><br />Top<br /><br />Myths and misconceptions concerning infant constipation:<br /><br />  * Iron in the formula causes constipation. No way. I can understand lay people thinking this to be the case because when adults take iron preparations (in large doses) they may become constipated. But the tiny amount present in infant formula is not nearly enough to cause any problems.<br /><br />  The irritating thing to me is to hear doctors and nurses who should know better repeating this nonsense and switching the infants to the less healthy low- or no-iron formulas.<br /><br />  * Increasing water in the diet is commonly recommended; it makes very little sense and demonstrates a failure to reflect on the basic physiologic cause of the overdry stool. The problem is too little water retention in the stool, not too little water in the body! Unless there is increased fiber or some chemical substance such as a sugar (Karo簧, lactulose) to retain the water in the stool, excess water will simply wind up in the diaper as urine.<br /><br />Top",0
2039,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net.  What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.  People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage.  It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food.  What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.  It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food.  The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).  I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One.  It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

2041,"Hello:<br /><br />I felt it was important for me to share this review with fellow parents. I have been trying to make a decision on an organic formula (weighing the pros and cons of Earth's Best and Baby's Only) and I have done weeks of research, I have read the cornucopia reports, combed clinical studies I could find on the internet regarding DHA/ARA, websites of all the major formaula manufacturer's, research on hexane, etc, etc, and I finally talked to my pediatrician. Here is a summary of what I found:<br /><br />Earth's Best:<br />Major Pro: Milk-based. My pediatrician was adamant that the first ingredient in an infant formula should be milk. Despite opinions I've seen out there about the composition of carbs - lactose and other sugars - in breast milk and its similarity to composition in Baby's only, there is no doubt that formula should be milk-based. All forms of syrup - whether it is corn syrup or brown rice syrup are sugars, and not suitable substitutes for lactose. These sugars can not only lead to problems with obesity and diabetes later in life, but the lack of lactose does not sufficiently meet an infant's nutritional needs.<br /><br />Major Con: Hexane-derived DHA. By the way, it's not just the organic formulas that have this controversial method of DHA/ARA extraction. Every formula on the market - organic and non-organic has DHA derived in this way. I called every formula manufacturer to verify this. (Martek's LifeDHA is also white-labeled - so you dont always know that it is Martek. But if there is DHA/ARA added to an infant formula or food, whether it is labeled or not, it is almost always going to be from Martek)<br /><br />Baby's only:<br />Major Pro: No DHA/ARA - It is the ONLY formula on the market I can find without DHA/ARA - if anyone else can find another formula, organic or non-organic, let me know! I have literally scoured the marketplace. The only place to find it is Canada (Nestle Good Start) and it's not easy to purchase and ship to the U.S.<br /><br />Major Con: My pediatrician confirmed that brown rice syrup as a first ingredient in an infant formula is not acceptable. She says while Nature's One may market it as better because it doesn't spike insulin levels, at the end of the day it is still sugar, just a different form of corn syrup. She was very concerned that nutritionally this is not suitable for an infant. The other con of baby's only is that it is indeed a toddler formula. When you compare the mineral values you will see for example that the levels of calcium, phosphorous, iodine and a few others are much higher than in other infant formulas. In fact their vitamin/mineral content is more comparable to other toddler formulas on the market, like Good Start 2. I have researched that the higher mineral content could make an infant's kidney system work harder. Not sure of long-term effects, if any. This was outside of my research.<br /><br />Bottom line: I know that many proponents of Baby's only will say that the company is taking a political stance, in fact it does encourage breastfeeding until 12 months, but it also discourages the introduction of dairy milk at 12 months, which really goes against the APA recommendation to introduce dairy milk at 12 months. I have no doubt that Baby's only is meant for toddlers, in fact they tell you to consult a physician if you're offering it to an infant under 12 months. They don't do this for PC reasons, they are a company that cares about revenues, just like all the other formula companies. They say this because it is indeed a toddler formula meant for babies 12 months +<br /><br />There is no perfect solution out there. But I've decided to continue my hunt for a milk-based formula without DHA/ARA, whether organic or non-organic. In the meantime, I can only do what all other parents do - make the best choice having weighed the pros and cons. I choose Earth's best. Why? Because I've done enough research to feel confident that the likelihood of hexane solvent remaining in formula is highly unlikely. My research, which includes talking to a scientist that uses hexane in his laboratory, indicates that hexane is highly volatile and evaporates almost immediately. In other words, by the time it has extracted the oils, it should have evaporated. While you can never be 100% sure of anything in this world, the independent studies do show that no traces of hexane are in the formula). I know it's hard to believe everything you read, so I am only sharing all of this information because I feel it would be wasted if I kept it all to myself! At the end of the day, I feel the nutritional benefit of a milk-based formula outweighs the very small (perhaps non-existent) chance of hexane traces in formula.<br /><br />I hope this helps!",1

Of course, adding syrup just adds to the flames. This product simply gives you lots of empty calories which adds weight.

2048,"The Godiva chocolate was as expected, beautifully and elegantly packaged.  It arrived very quickly, too.  It was a gift so I don't know how it tasted, but I don't imagine there will be any complaints in that department:)  The only downside was the exhorbitant amount of shipping fees charged.  There's no way it cost that much to ship and the total price with shipping made it more expensive than it's probably worth.",1
2049,These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that the fancy packaging makes no mention that it contains sucralose (aka Splenda - just google what artificial sugars do to your body) and modified food starch (contains glutamate/glutamatic acid like MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome enough to put this garbage into your body. You might as well just eat sugar free candy. It tastes a lot better.<br /><br />Emerald needs to realize that people eat nuts for a healthier diet; they don't want to eat the same artificial junk that you can find in a candy bar. Emerald is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage. All the other brands have more natural ingredients. Stay away from the Emerald brand.,1
2050,"My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!",1
2051,"An Asian friend of mine introduced these Nong Shim Spicy noodles (beef flavor) to me and I was hooked from day 1.<br />I love spicy and these are SPICY.<br />You get 2 bags of condiments: one is the red Cayenne, beef flavor  and spice mix (contains MSG, fyi) and the other is dried chopped vegetables (including chinese mushroom flakes that sweel in the cooking cycle).<br /><br />Preparation: Boil water (determine how watery you want it), add condiments, and noodles (round shape, perfectly fits a small pan). Before the noodles get soft switch off the heat and let it sit for 2 minutes and enjoy.<br /><br />That is not how we eat it though: when not in the mood to cook a big meal or when we have left over meat or vegetables we will boil them into this (peas, cauliflower, chicken... hotdogs..) Sky is the limit.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Famous Nong Shim noodles taste great (we always have a box in the house)<br />- You can turn it into a full meal with leftovers<br />- Plenty spicy<br />- Not the thin ramen but Korean style thicker ones. Great mouth feel if not cooked too soft.<br />- Nice chopped vegetables in the condiments<br />- Larger per meal than the regular icky ramen that people buy for 30c a piece (ewww)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Contains MSG<br />- Some people become gassy from these (Amazon has good deals on Beano)<br />- The Seafood and other versions of these are HORRIBLE tasting. Make sure you get the red box beef flavored spicy ones.",1

2054,"Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of ""buck$"" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with ""chocolat chaud"" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.<br /><br />At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!<br /><br />Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!<br /><br />OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a ""bowl of soul,"" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others.

2059,"I've had nutritional yeast once before in the form of a ""Mac and Chreese""-in-a-box product and loved it. While it wasn't as much cheesy as it was garlicky, I had high hopes that ""nooch"" could satisfy the instinctual human need for Velveeta-style ""cheeze"". I could never find it at a grocery store OR a health store so I finally ordered this on Amazon.<br /><br />Wow. Yeah, I said wow. I used this in a recipe for ""Cheeze Sauce"" that was fat-free and it was amazing. Plus it had tons of protein, fiber, and of course the illustrious vitamin B-12! There are other similar recipes that call for LOTS of margarine that sound even cheesier and richer.<br /><br />This bottle lasted me about 2 recipes with a little leftover for sprinkling, so if you're new to cooking with nutritional yeast this is a good size to start with. I've since bought a 22-oz container of a different brand, but this brand is just as good.<br /><br />In conclusion...buy this, make lots of cheeze/chreese or any intentional misspelling of ""cheese"" you desire, be nice to animals and get 150% of your daily value of B-12.",1

2063,"Steel cut oatmeal has a grainy, hearty texture that's more like al dente pasta than mush.  American grown varieties often have a gelatinous texture between the grains.  The Irish grown oatmeal is firm and nutty through and through.<br /><br />My electric range cooks the oatmeal in about 25 minutes.  I use a straight-edged spatula to keep the oatmeal from sticking to the bottom of the pan.  Avoid over-stirring to keep that nice, firm texture.<br /><br />More good news: Steel-cut oatmeal, like chili or stew, is better on the second day.  Pour your leftovers into a bowl, lay plastic film directly on the surface of the oatmeal, and store in the 'fridge.  Reheat in the microwave with a spoonful of water for a minute or two.<br /><br />Genuine maple syrup is the best sweetener for oatmeal, in my opinion.

However, the menu is complete trash, the extras are EXTREMELY embarassing, and to play the movie you actually have to click on scene selections and click on the first chapter because there is no PLAY button! What's the problem here? As I recall, this film is on AFI's top 100 funniest movies ever made, so don't you think they could make a better DVD than this garbage? I am so sick and tired of these movie companies getting away with selling us trash.<p>This double sided disk is no good. Pick what format you want the first time you watch it, and stick with that side the whole time...because if you switch each time, both sides get scratched!

We also didn't want to use any pesticides, since we had four small house pets.<br /><br />When we moved to Michigan, we continued using the traps because our child was born, and we felt even more strongly about avoiding pesticides. Although we did not have a flea problem, the traps have caught several types of spiders, the occasional house fly, a few random creepy crawlies, and even a hornet! Basically, they seem to trap anything attracted to the light/heat.<br /><br />We keep them tucked away, out of sight (ex: in a back corner of our furnace room, under furniture), and in places where the pets can't get too curious -- getting a refill stuck to your skin (or dog fur) is the absolute worse.<br /><br />All in all, I think we've been using these traps for nearly ten years now. The bulbs can be replaced with regular night light bulbs or the new LED bulbs.",1

Give it a try.  I paid $6.89 for just one at the local health food store. This is a much better deal!<br /><br />I wanted to add that I posted this description under Pamela's Pancake mix. I have also used the Chocolate cake mix and the bread mix. Since this is posted under all 3 for some reason I will comment on those too. The Bread mix is very good. It does take a little tweaking, maybe it's my bread machine. It is very good, everyone in the family likes it. We have made pizza crust out of it for my little girl and she loves it. We have made the cookies from the pancake mix and she loves them, we add cinnamon and sugar to them before baking. The Chocolate Cake mix is very good, it is more of a dark chocolate than a milk chocolate. We make cupcakes out of them and freeze them. Nice and fluffy. She loves them too. All in all I would say that if you can't have wheat, Pamela's products are the best choice for flavor and texture. Don't buy that already made bread.

None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called ""monosodium glutamate,"" had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When ""monosodium glutamate"" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" did not appear until ""monosodium glutamate"" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an ""industry arranged whitewash"" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers ""voluntarily"" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in ""low fat"" and ""no fat"" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using ""monosodium glutamate."" In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a ""clean label"" ingredient.",0

2087,"I am continually amazed at the shoddy treatment that some movies get in their DVD release.  This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is.  I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<p>This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<p>My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.",1
2088,"Toothpicks really make me sentimental. I remember well my first toothpick, ""Gabriel."" An admirable piece of wood, so graceful in the ways of dislodging food from between ones teeth, his dance like the effortless grace of a Darcey Bussell. Alas, I was but a child and misused Gabriel, splintering him on an unprincipled frog bone snagged between my first and second premolars. I will never forget Gabriel. On the someteenth anniversary of his removal of a very recalcitrant pomegranate seed I decided to peruse Amazon for a replacement. I was suprised at the results.<br /><br />This product advertises itself as ""low-in-fat, high-in-taste."" This is marvellous because I am on a diet. A good majority of us lack the digestive enzymes necessary to process wood. Although, my colleague Gareth Mitchell Headgraves is a rarity. I admit I become anxious when I leave himself alone in a room with a good piece of teak. In any case, despite a few misguided efforts, I cannot digest wood and will reaffirm that for most of us this product is low in fat.<br /><br />After trying this product I became intruiged by a fellow reviewer's suggestion to try making your own home brew cinammon sticks. His have been brewing for 29 years. This engorged my curiousity. What flavours could I impregnate a toothpick with? Could I try a sweet Canary wine? Or a supple juniper extract? Perhaps a melegueta pepper?<br /><br />3 stars because this product only opened up my curiousity for new toothpick flavours, and now find cinnamon to be lacking.<br /><br />PS - fortunately for the parsimonious among us, Amazon has this item listed as used.",0
2089,"I was a big fan of raw chocolate, in fact I have ordered from Navitas for their cacao powder. However, I have recently found out that cacao powder has the highest source of THEOBROMINE which a neurotoxin. Having cacao powder on a CONSISTENT BASIS has been shown to cause tremble, sweating, nausea among a list of other side-effects. So essentially, you are harming your brain when eating chocolate. You might be very surprised to learn of these side-effects as I was myself but please do your OWN RESEARCH and you will come across same conclusions.<br />Even the natives in South America never used cacoa as supplements. The fresh fruit from that comes from cacao plant(aka theobroma plant) is what the natives eat and use for making drinks. The fruit is harmless but it is the seeds inside the fruit, which are used to make this powder or any chocolate, that are extremely harmful.<br />I have heard Carob is an excellent alternative.",0
2090,"Previously to receiving this system, hubby and I were attempting to train our 2 young kitties to use a human toilet, to no avail.  I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay).  That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well.<br /><br />Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts).  This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore.  They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter.  So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it.<br /><br />I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise.  I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl.  Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated.  :P<br /><br />All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets.  That would be AWESOME... *nudge nudge to the litter companies*",1

The dark roast coffee pods seem to taste so much better than any other brand or flavor I have ever made from home.  The dark roast blend is simply the best. It is smooth, rich, and brews so quickly in our new machine, it's fantastic.

2096,"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!",1

2098,"For those of us used to Tuna in the can this product seems very unique and certainly economical if you have several people in your family.<br />What you are getting is a single solid slab of tuna measuring approx. 6 inches wide 9 inches long and 1 inch thick. 2 whole pounds of Wild Planet's low mercury wild caught tuna. As you can see from the reviews of their canned Tuna this really is a very delicious Tuna and they cook it right in the aluminum type pouch that it comes in. When you open the pouch the juices from that cooking are evident. I know many of you probably have bought fresh Tuna in the fish market and find canned Tuna of no comparison. I, myself have only done that once and it turned out very dry and leathery when broiled. I don't know how to compare a Tuna loin like this to a fresh cooked piece of Tuna but if you don't have access to fresh tuna or just want a high quality Tuna for sandwiches or other dishes I truly don't know where you could find a higher quality and certainly more economical piece of fish. This truly is a novel idea whose time has come. Taking a large, fresh piece of fish and putting it in a sealed pouch and cooking it. It is the next best thing to fresh fish, especially when your favorite fish is not in season or available frozen.<br />I wish someone would package Sockeye Salmon like this. The only ingredients in this product are Tuna and sea salt. None of the extenders etc.. in commercial store bought Tuna. Now, Wild Planet's new can's of Tuna are 5 ounces, so you would have to buy 6 1/3 cans to equal this 2 lb. pouch. A cost of $27.00 verses $16.00. So you can see it certainly is a better bargin. The only caveat to ordering this product in such a large size is that once you open it you only have x amount of days to eat it. No problem for a family of 3 or 4 but if it is just one person it may prove to be a bit to much when all you want is one Tuna sandwich, but, I have found that by eating a little each day I can finish a package in 4 days just by having a piece once a day. It's a great way to get some extra protein and omega 3's and I really look forward to having it because it tastes so good. I hope this was helpful.",1

By the way, the box it was shipped in looked fine... the cans within it (shrink wrapped in plastic with an Amazon ""ready to ship"" sticker) did not. So, the damage clearly happened before they were even boxed up rather than during shipping.

The rich brown color comes from being aged in wood casks, often for decades. Although it is made from grapes, balsamic vinegar isn't produced from wine (as are most vinegars).

Plagues of locusts and killer bees and whatever species the Philly Phanatic belongs to?<br /><br />I decided to prepare myself for the next natural disaster by making sure I'll always have access to the four basic necessities: Food.

The last level is ""Aceto Balsamico di Modena"", which can be really bad and there are no controls over what goes into it (artificial coloring, etc.).<br /><br />That being said, Fondo Carrate vinegar is producted from grapes grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides of any kind. Organically grown and produced exclusively from ancient D.O.C. Lambrusco varieties of the Mastri, Salamino and Sorbara grapes.  It is 12 years old and aged in oak.  Very smooth, sweet, but tangy.  It really is a fine vinegar, especially for the price.  You can get it for a bit less than $32 from other distributors, but I'm not sure how the shipping compares.

2113,"Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively ""tested"" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to ""testing"" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom.",1

Table salt, because it is refined, is unhealthy and toxic. But what our body really requires is natural pure salt.<br /><br />Hence the confusion in the minds of many. There are two forms of salt - bad salt and good salt. Eating table salt will actually deprive your body of the real salt and minerals that you need for healthy living.""<br /><br />""Celtic Sea Salt is the moist salt that has been harvested from the Atlantic sea water off the coast of Brittany in France. It is harvested using the Celtic method of wooden rakes. No metal touches the salt. It is then naturally aired and sun-dried in clay ponds and gathered by wooden tools to preserve its living enzymes. Because of its unrefined nature it contains all of the 84 beneficial live elements found in the sea water. No chemicals and preservatives or additives are contained within Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Among the live minerals and trace elements found in Celtic sea salt are iodine, iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and zinc.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking.",0

2129,"As of the date of this review, the product title indicates ""dark chocolate with orange flavor,"" but the picture and description are for their regular 72% dark chocolate bars.<br /><br />Vivani is perhaps my favorite chocolate, so I took a chance on this ambigious product hoping to get the 72% cocoa version.<br /><br />Bzzzzt.  They sent me the orange flavored stuff.  But I called and asked Amazon to try again.  Bingo!  Got the good stuff.  But both versions had the same ASIN numbers on the boxes....<br /><br />Anyway, IMHO Vivani makes some of the best tasting off-the-shelf dark chocolate you can buy.  I like their 85% cocoa even better, but Amazon doesn't stock it, and the 72% is very good (and less expensive than my local store).<br /><br />Compared to the other dark chocolate Amazon offers (Cote D'or), the Vivani is much smoother, tastier, less flat, and better texture.",1
2130,"The folks giving bad reviews on this product don't seem to understand that creamed coconut is not the same as condensed coconut milk. It contains coconut-meat solids and is pulpier/thicker, and will not taste like coconut milk by thinning it out with water.<br />What you get: inside the green box you see in the picture is a plastic-wrapped block of creamed coconut. Unless your house is very warm, it will be rock-hard. I fill a bowl with hot tap water and immerse the entire package, then knead it with my fingers after a few minutes. Repeat a couple of times, then snip the package open and pour/squeeze it out like toothpaste for use in cooking. If you don't use the entire package all at once it will resolidify; that's not because there's anything ""wrong"" with it, that's just what real coconut cream does.  That's why I love these little packages, as opposed to the 16-oz jars of other brands that they sell at Whole Foods Market.",1
2131,"I had heard Mum Mums were a great finger food for babies so as soon as I got the OK from my son's pediatrician to start finger foods/teething biscuits, I purchased these.

2134,"I was disappointed to find out EZ-sweet uses Sodium Benzoate as one of it's preservatives. This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper. I don't know how I would measure out 1oz to make a 4 oz bottle of sweetener solution so, for me, it's just easier to get 1oz, it will last us a while and the 4oz bottle on the coffee counter doesn't take up much space at all. I'm going to experiment with different natural preservatives (colloidal silver, GSE, natural salts, citric acid) to keep the solution from becoming contaminated with bacteria or fungus. If you're going to go this route, do some research on natural preservatives and if you find one you love, please leave a comment to this review.<br /><br />Note: I was lucky that the splendex company agreed to give me a 4oz bottle to use for my sucralose solution, I'm not sure if they would do that for everyone. If not, just keep your old EZ squeeze bottle or find a nice dropper bottle that will do the job without making a mess. Oh and finding the powder wasn't easy. It is not an option on their home/default web page. I had to go to order products and on the right side was an option for the powder.",0
2135,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff.

2138,"My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year, and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.<br /><br />A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it, you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.<br /><br />You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.<br /><br />Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience, however, it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.<br /><br />When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water, I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This coconut water might not be fresh and raw, but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.<br /><br />The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8"" opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.<br /><br />It is best served cold, so I kept in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming, but just right.<br /><br />It has no added flavors or sugars to it, which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.<br /><br />I have compared it to fresh coconut water, and although I do prefer raw fresh water, I am very happy with this as a substitute.<br /><br />I can say this, my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.<br /><br />If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic, trip, or even to work, this is definitely a great item to have handy.<br /><br />You might like it even if you are not into raw foods, but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.<br /><br />I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.",1

2145,"I have tried to lose weight for a long, l o n g, time.  Also for a long, l o n g time, I have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea.  It seemed ridiculous to me at first.... I mean, lose weight by DRINKING TEA?  This idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts, (which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours....after which time it comes back again!)<br /><br />Well, last year I was getting pretty desperate.  I had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds....by drinking only regular tea, instant coffee, and home-made lemonade, and eating only Bird's Eye Vegetables and turkey. (In fact, I have invented the ""Turkey Diet""! It's very simple: Eat Turkey, Fall Asleep (from the tryptophan!).....and if you fall asleep, you can't eat, you see.  A variation, I guess, on the ""Hollywood Diet"", which can be used only on weekends....because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work!)  Anyway, this diet worked for me....but it was pretty boring....took most of my free time away, and....turkey is expernsive!  I gradually stopped this diet, and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds.  I looked desperately for another way to lose weight....but drinking tea to do it just didn't logical....<br /><br />However, no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea....and after all that expensive (but delicious!), turkey, it seemd a good way to go.  Now, this particular tea itself IS quite expensive -- $43 for 4 ounces, (on sale....ouch!)....but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups, (360 ounces...and I'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener)....so I figured, why not?  (Well...because of the possible bad taste, that's why not.  I've tried herbal teas in the past, and -- with the delicious exception of Jasmine Tea -- thoroughly disliked each one.)  But even so, I decided to risk it...I've tasted far worse things than herbal tea, after all....<br /><br />So, about a year ago, I sent away for it.<br /><br />When the Wu-Long tea arrived, (in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag, lined with aluminum foil, giving the impression of a crushed green diamond), I made it and drank it.  Hmmm, (or rather, ""Mmmm!"")  Not bad tasting at all!  It tasted like the best black tea...the kind, (other than Jasmine), that I like the best.  But,,,,as the tea was SO expensive, I decided not to drink it too often....<br /><br />As the owner of a ""healthy refrigerator"", (one LOADED with vitamins, which I take only in emergencies, because I can't afford to keep buying them), I now had this ""healthy tea"", which I put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh), to sort of keep the vitamins company!  I did throughly read the literature that came with the tea, however....and noticed that many people had praised the MEDICINAL qualities of this tea, along with it's weight-loss abilities.  Hmmm....  I decided that I had happily gotten more than I bargained for....a weight-loss tea AND one which helpoed with other health problems.  Nice to get such a bargain -- but, at $43 for 4 ounces of lose tea, it was still quite expensive.  And so, after that first cup, I restrained myself from drinking it, for quite some time.....<br /><br />Actually, I didn't drink another cup until about two weeks ago!  I was beginning to feel as if the minor cut I had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in, (though the cut itself didn't look infected.)<br /><br />Anyway, I was beginning to feel very, Very, VERY w....e....a...k.....  Two years ago, in fact, I was hospitalized with an infection....the very same infection that killed my mother the month before!  My mother, in the hospital, had said that she ""felt like a vegetable"", and, having gotten the same infection, I knew how accurate that description really was: I was SO weak, then, in fact, I had had trouble raising my arms above my head!  And now I felt it was starting to happen again!  My first thought was to call 911.  But my second thought was, strangely, concentrated on those glowing testimonials I had read from other customers who had used Wu-Long tea.  I figured I'd try to make myself a cup....if the tea didn't work, I could always call 911....  After all, though I felt very weak, I didn't feel totally paralzyed....yet, anyway.  But I knew I had to make and drink that tea fast.....before total weakness engulfed me.  Did I feel up to doing so?  Yes....I F...took my time, I F...I was very careful, and...I F.. I stayed very near the telephone as I made the tea....just in case....<br /><br />I managed to make myself the cup of tea....to wait for it to cool down a bit....and to drink it.  Within an hour, the feeling of weakness had left me!  And, as of this writing....taking place a full two weeks later....the weakness, (and presumably the infection), have not come back!<br /><br />(OH, IF ONLY I HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO BUY THIS TEA ..T W O.. YEARS AGO, AND GIVE IT TO MY WONDERFUL MOTHER!!!!!!)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone, and in every circumstance.  The tea did NOT transform my looks to those of Princess Grace, (whom I consider the most beautiful woman of all time), and have NOT cured me of a very slight case of Myasthenia Gravis...a neuro-muscular ailment which I have had since the age of four.  I DOUBT very much that it has made me immortal, and I know for a fact that it has NOT granted me super-powers, or the ability to fly, or to transcend time.<br /><br />(No one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination! : )  HOWEVER, UPON DRINKING THAT TEA, MY FEELINGS OF INFECTION, (a feeling of weakness quite different from that of Myasthenia Gravis), DID GO AWAY!  I don't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were....but I'm sure, now, that at least 98% of them are true!<br /><br />Perhaps there is no real ""fountain of youth"".  But this tea...which seems to cure many ailments, and most probably helps one lose weight as well, if taken often enough, seems a very close second.  Ponce de Leon would have been happy with it, I'm sure.  I don't know if it will help everyone...but I do know it helped me, (and probably the other people who gave testimonials, too.)  And that second cup of tea -- even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea -- are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital!  For those on a budget, like me, Wu-Long tea is, it seems, destined to be used as a luxury, and/or in an emergency.  But I really feel it belongs in every home.....just like aspirin does.  And -- for emergency use...PLEASE take the same precautions I did: 1) Be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea, and 2) Be near a telephone, so you can call 911, in case the tea doesn't work for you.<br /><br />The tea did work for me, in the above circumstance, anyway.  An elixir of life?  Perhaps and perhaps not, depending on the person and the circumstances.  All I know is, that for me, and under the circumstances described above, it certainly seems to have saved mine!",0
2146,"These multrigrain chips taste like restaurant-quality corn tortilla chips, but they come in individual-sized bags.

He loves the taste of the Chicken Vita-Gravy mixed with the Hi-Tor Neo. Now he's getting the extra nutrition he needs to balance his blood levels, while really enjoying the taste!

It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.",1

These individual packs might be nice to have in my purse when I am out and about, but at approximately 25 cents a serving, they make absolutely no sense to have in my kitchen!  I did find some canisters for sale on a kosher grocery website and just stocked up.

2161,"Senseo recently released several flavored varieties. Having always been partial to hazelnut coffee and being the happy owner of a Senseo coffee maker, I just had to give this new flavor a try. Well, let me tell you... I'm hooked! There is so much rich flavor in this coffee it's hard to believe the drink is calorie-free. It has the complex, subtle, thick texture and flavor of a fat- and carb-laden drink. If you've been worrying lately about the effects of your daily Caramel Macchiato on your waistline (not to mention your wallet) you have to give this coffee a try. It's wonderful and guilt-free! The pods are a little more expensive than regular varieties (the package is the same price but there are slightly fewer pods per bag) but boy is it worth that little extra!<br /><br />This flavor was all I needed to decide me to buy a second Senseo machine for my office. It's very quiet and doesn't bother my cube neighbors, and it's already paid for itself because I no longer spend a fortune at the coffee shop for mediocre coffee: I have my ""candy bar in a cup"" (to quote Paula) right at my desk.<br /><br />Senseo has a winner with this one... Give it a try!",1

2165,"Being a type II diabetic is challenging when it comes to desserts. Concerned that I was consuming too many products using artificial sweeteners and while researching some other products (allergic to stevia and agave), I came across the SweetTree Blonde evaporated palm sugar which claims a glycemic index of 35. My body has had positive gylcemic reactions to sesame and coconut products and I made the purchase on faith that the glycemic load using this sugar versus artificial sweeteners would be similar. I made a batch of cookies using Splenda and another batch using the SweetTree blonde sugar and then tested my blood glucose.  I did this repeatedly over the course of about 7 days and was pleasantly surprised that my blood sugars in both cases were consistently within a few points of each other.  So, for my body I found this sugar to be just as good a substitute as splenda.  For my money, I would rather put something in me that is closer to nature. We use it now in our morning coffee and the company will be releasing a new liquid version of the product in the fall sometime.",1

2167,"I got my agar agar yesterday, and I feel like I've been scammed.  The only reason I chose to buy from Barry Farm was that it was the cheapest option.  But that wasn't the case.<br /><br />When I first held the package (which is smaller than what is pictured here), I thought it was oddly light for 4 oz.  So I weighed it on my military grade digital scale and bingo, it's 3.2 oz.  Without the packaging that would mean 3 oz.  I thought it might be my scale so I weighed my mineral makeup that came on the same day, 1.3 pounds each for a 1 pound bag.  So Barry Farm only shipped me 3 oz of product when I payed for 4 oz, which doesn't seem like a lot but when you do the calculations it's quite a dent.<br /><br />Let me compare this to the other agar option on Amazon by NOW Foods.<br /><br />Barry Farm (3 oz) $7.90 + $7.13 (Shipping) =  $15.03 (Comes in a plastic Ziploc bag)<br /><br />NOW Foods (2 oz) $4.20 + $5.38 (Shipping) = $9.58/2 = $4.79/oz * 3 = $14.37 for 3 oz (Comes in a plastic bottle)<br /><br />NOW Foods (32 oz) $40.79 + $7.55) = $48.34/32 = $1.51/oz *3 = $4.53<br /><br />So including shipping,<br /><br />Barry Farm $15.03/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $14.37/3 oz<br />NOW Foods  $ 4.53/3 oz<br /><br />With a bottle instead of a plastic bag, my future purchases would be from NOW Foods.  I'm so tempted to get the 2 Pound bottle since an ounce is only $1.51 that way, but agar's gelling quality is so good that it gets used very slowly.<br /><br />Now about the agar.  I cooked it last night (1 Cup apple juice to 1/2 teaspoon powder), and left it in the fridge.  This morning I woke up to see it gelled quite nicely.  It doesn't have the doinky texture of gelatin jello and it's much harder to the touch.  I tasted it and didn't notice an exponential increase in the taste of apple juice, and the texture of the agar isn't as good as gelatin jello. It sort of just breaks apart in your mouth like...sand maybe? But at least it's supposedly healthy.<br /><br />So in terms of Barry Farms I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because at least the product worked.  But not going to buy from them again since I don't know if I'll be cheated.  Internets a scary place where merchant reputation is very important.  They should have put more product in the bag to ensure it measures at least 4 oz.  Now their reputation is tarnished.",1
2168,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

2171,"I believe it was the esteemed Neil Patrick Harris who, eons ago, said ""Suit up. It's going to be legendary!"" Mr. Harris would never admit it because he never was one for product endorsements, but I'mma blow the lid off this mystery: He was talking about Coffee-mate's Pumpkin Spice Creamer.<br /><br />Upon hearing that this product existed, I promptly began to hyperventilate and had to be awakened by smelling salts. To say that I love anything pumpkin-flavored would be the biggest understatement since... well... I'm looking for historical precedents here, but I'm really not well-versed in the history of understatements. Anyway, I digress; after being awakened, I promptly drove 107 mph the entire way to the store, causing 7 minor traffic accidents, a stampede of antelope, and at least one unplanned pregnancy. I then sprinted to the Dairy section, mind racked with anticipation and apprehension; would they truly have the Holy Grail of coffee creamers, or would I be left utterly disappointed, like that time when I was seven and my parents ate my entire birthday cake right in front of me, laughing the whole time?<br /><br />And then, I saw it: A fully-stocked shelf of Coffee-mate Pumpkin Spice Creamer. I gasped in delight as I grabbed the nearest bottle off of the shelf, passionately ripped off the lid, clawed desperately at that Godforsaken plastic freshness seal, and chugged the entire bottle on the spot. For what seemed like hours, I collapsed on the floor of the supermarket, chest heaving in pure ecstasy as a subtle afterglow began to emanate from every pore of my skin.<br /><br />Long story short, I'm serving a lengthy prison sentence now for not only my incredibly lewd public display (I don't even REMEMBER taking my pants off), but also my inadvertent destruction of the entire Dairy section. And you know something? I'd do it ALL again. And I will, as soon as I'm out. Be prepared.<br /><br />Also, it's now January, so if you want in on this, RUN to your nearest grocery store and get some, or else you will live in regret until October when it comes out again.

2173,"I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, ""our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)""<br /><br />Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word ""rich"" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.<br /><br />It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.<br /><br />I would reason that the fact your coffee costs ""4x less than Starbucks Via"" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself ""Taster's Choice""  Who's choice?  A zombie?<br /><br />Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes ""the smart choice"" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!",0

2175,"I tasted Lavazza many times being in Italy as well in France and excellent quality (taste, smell) of it can't be confused with anything else. Have to regret - I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with this ""Lavazza Super Crema"" beans from Amazon - it's under-roasted, bitter and acid taste, weak (yes, there was a typo) and unpleasant smell and crema....well, even relatively old coffee beans from TJ Maxx produce better crema with proper grind&tamping or even just with the pressurized portafilter.<br />I'm using semi-automatic espresso machine (DeLongi BAR32 before and now Saeco Aroma, Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder) about 5 years (I mean I'm not a novice for espresso), and have tried this beans immediately after the bag was opened (1st ""news"" - very weak smell), used fresh grind, careful and dense tamping, machine is properly heated and primed.<br />The consumption date on the package marked as October of 2011 and I know that Lavazza's shelf life is 14 months - therefore, received in March 2010, it's 6 months old roast, not too fresh but I had used much older roasts without any problems. Not sure how it works for latte but as espresso coffee it's wasted money and lost expectation. Don't be fooled by positive reviews - some people never tried the real espresso and some even don't like it but coffee-infused milk drink. Also note that Amazon sells some Lavazza coffee's for much higher price and no ""subscription"" proposed. The attractive price($16 per kg with subscription)is definitely result of poor quality - something wrong with this ""Lavazza Super Crema"" coffee.",1
2176,"After reading some of the reviews, I almost got scared off this, and am glad I didn't.<br /><br />I did batch cooking for my first two kids, who are now 3 and 4. When it came time to move my 6 month old into solids, I wanted to home make his food also. But since I have less time and freezer space, batch cooking just wasn't feasible. I wanted to make his foods from the ingredients I was using for the family meals. Trying to puree small amounts in a regular size blender or processor is impossible. I saw this and though it would make meal time easier - and it does!<br /><br />Now the baby eats what we are eating, just steamed and pureed. I can make 3-4 servings at a time and just put the extras in singe serve containers in the fridge. I cooked a whole chicken, pulled off the meat and out it into small snack sized bags and put them in the freezer. Now while I am cooking for the older kids, I put one serving of chicken, with some veggies and/or fruit in the cooker and it cooks away while I am making dinner for the rest if the family. E.A.S.Y.<br /><br />-The mold issue other reviewers shouldn't be a problem, if you make sure the reservoir is empty and  leave the top off so that it can air dry. Same for the blender/steamer parts. Just dry them between uses. I use water from my Brita to reduce build up between descaling. If your reservoir in a regular steamer isn't emptied all the way, it will do the same thing.<br /><br />-The counter top footprint is small, about 職 of the size of my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. It's small and does small amounts, it doesn't say that it does large batches. So I'm confused as to how people are disappointed that it doesn't do large batches. It states it has a 2 翻 cup bowl.<br /><br />-The Beaba website sells the replacement parts all separately which I liked, just in case something needs replacing.  I cook a lot and have has to replace blades on my large processor, so I'm glad that the parts are so easy to get.<br /><br />-The steamer does shut off automatically and the light goes off, but just like a regular steamer, if you leave food over boiling water, it will continue to soften. The booklet gives you the times for the steamer, so timing it is actually pretty easy. (Level 1 on the bowl is 7 minutes, level 2 is 10 minutes, level 3 is 15 minutes).<br /><br />-The Beaba website has more free recipes. (My kiddos fav is 2/3 pumpkin, 1/3 pear and a dash of pumpkin pie spice)<br /><br />-The blender part worked great for my 6 month old, totally pureed the pumpkin, carrot, sweet potato, pear, nectarine, banana and butternut squash that I pureed in there. I thinned with water or pear juice.<br /><br />-You hold the switch to the right to puree the food. For me, it's not a big deal to hold a switch for 30-60 seconds. So I don't see this as a design flaw.<br /><br />-The top and bottom don't line up perfectly - they can't or else too much pressure would build up in the steamer and it would pressure cook the food, not steam it.<br /><br />In short, This is my 3rd baby that I've cooked for at home, and I love this. Some of the design flaws others talked about aren't really flaws at all. I have to cook a meal for the kids at 5 and one for my hubby and I at 7 when he gets home. This makes it easy to make the baby's food at the same time with the same ingredients.",1

If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone..."".

This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.

2189,"I waited with baited breath for the arrival of the 20 Fresh Whole Rabbit's to arrive so my children and I could begin production of our own Watership Down Reenactment.  Shipping was lightening fast and our props arrived securely packed in dry ice.  Imagine my surprise when I found that the heads and paws of my little actors were missing?!?!  They don't even have skin.  I can handle the lack of internal organs of course.  What really matters are the external features of stage props.<br /><br />Not to be defeated my 12 year old daughter made a resourceful suggestion.  Why should we not replace the missing head and limbs with paper machete.  This is the sort of innovation that convinces me that Tabitha has a destiny on Broadway!!!<br /><br />Despite the inconvenience of having to build the body parts I must say these carcasses are well suited to the task.  They are easy to perforate with wire.  A brushing of super glue and a roll in fuzz and we have our little actors.<br /><br />Also:  They are posse able to a certain degree if you wire them in place.  This was very helpful for certain scenes in our production.<br /><br />One more negative however,  after 5 dress rehearsals our little actors smell quite bad.  This is, in my opinion a design flaw that should be part of this product description.  For that reason I am giving this 3 stars.  Sure it was workable material but it was not everything I should get for paying so much for 20 of these!",1

Yeah. Holy Night indeed. Try calming down a seven year-old when her older brother mistook the hamster for a camel and started a play-fight between the ""camel"" and one of the sheep. Anyways, I misread the brand as Safe when it's Saf-Yeast. I thought the yeast would live longer than those annoying Sea Monkeys. Not. As another reviewer noted, my batch, too, tested DEAD! My daughter went into another tailspin while her brother mocked the baker on the package by pretending he was the baker killing the yeast as he put them in the mixing bowl. It took promising my little girl a bearded dragon for her birthday and grounding my son for a week before she finally quit crying.

2193,"Premium chocolates (such as Black Panther) have much character and subtlety in their flavor, with aromas that are fruity and spicy.

In addition, 10% of net profits go to help endangered species or indigenous peoples.<br /><br />This chocolate is barely sweet, but more sweetness would detract from the intense flavor, as well as raise the glycemic index that we're better off without.

2199,"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly.",1
2200,"I use three of these across one of my storage shelves in my kitchen. I also have the large drawer that fits under the Keurig. Essentially these 54 pod drawers are for my overflow.<br />This particular brand - Nifty - is... well.... quiet nifty! It's reasonably priced. There are other brands that make this same exact drawer and charge a lot more.<br />Hypothetically speaking, since I use this for storage, I supposed I could use the actual boxes the K cups come in.... but the nice thing about these drawers is that you can easily see when you are running low... versus going in the pantry and sticking your hand in your favorite K cup box to find only a few left (or worse... empty, because some used the last one and didn't tell you!).<br /><br />I think my only con to this is that the drawers are not smooth sliding drawers. Sometimes you have to shimmy the drawer a bit. But that holds true for those 'other' pricer versions as well.<br /><br />Also... you can actualy fit more than 54 in this drawer. I can fit 63. If you alternate between storing each K cup top side up and bottom side up in each row... you can fit 1 extra cup in each row. However, I don't think all of the rows are exactly the same size.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",0
2205,"FYI:  These tasty-looking cookies contain fish.<br /><br />If you aren't vegetarian, none of this will probably matter to you.  Nor should it.

Being vegetarian, I'm used to checking the ingredients of any new product I try.  I was disappointed to find that these cute 'lil mushroom cookies contain fish oil, so I can't eat them.  Too bad, considering how much everyone seems to like them.

2206,"I have a 1 year old lab/Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of ""is this useful votes"" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.

The body is unrivalled.  Everything is balanced in a way that is unique to the Kona bean, but there are no subtle undertones prevalent that make me like the Sumatran and Ethiopian beans so much better.  The beans are aesthetically perfect in every way, and I only have to use about 2/3 the portion of what I would use to make my favorite brews, but this is where it gets touchy for me.  I pay about $12-13 a lb for coffee that might not be better than Kona coffee, but I like it better.  Hawaii Growers makes a mighty fine coffee, one of the best Konas I've ever tasted, but it isn't worth more than $25 a lb.  No coffee is worth that to me, and I've tasted the world's finest.<br /><br />Hawaii Growers is very competitively priced compared to other Konas, so if Kona coffee is the drinker's coffee of choice, then Hawaii Growers is a great choice.

Although it no longer had paws, I got the distinct impression that the rabbit was flipping me off!  The irreverant beast was clear in its defiance.  Startled, I stepped back...I didnt quite know how to handle the situation.  I was quite frozen in shock.  The rabbit deftly kicked the box off the table and approached me with a confident swagger.  It seemed to be sizing me up.<br />  The next thing I knew, the rabbit had seized the box cutter from my trembling hand.  It weilded the blade with obvious expertise, waving it menacingly in front of my face.  I found myself completely immobilized with fear...a wave of morbid awareness drifted over me. There was nowhere to run.  Nowhere at all...<br />  The rabbit quickly stretched its naked, spindly legs and leapt from the table.  Within moments, it began to hurriedly ransack the house.  It spray-painted graffiti chickens all over my livingroom wall.  It broke into my safe and stole jewels and money.  It sold drugs and began extorting money from my neighbor.  It took candy from babies.  It sassed its elders.  I even found it in bed with my husband.<br />  Despite my outrage, and efforts to trap the abhorrent creature, it quickly spread its attentions throughout the neighborhood...then, the city.  It terrorized every man, woman and child...it spared no one.<br />  In desperation, I contacted the vendor for a refund.  ""Oh hell no,"" the customer service man said.  ""You wanted a fresh rabbit...and thats what you got.  No refunds!""<br />  Indeed, the rabbit was ""fresh"" and consequently recieved many outraged face slappings from local women. But I was desperate to be rid of the thing.  I found myself, desperate...alone...with nowhere to turn....  I wept bitter tears at the prospect of my fate and the humiliation I had endured as the rabbit effortlessly dismantled everything I valued in life. My back was against the wall...I had no choice but to fight.  The sound of my boots scraping upon the pavement of the sidewalk was comforting.  I was ready.  My jaw clenched and eyes squinted...I was pure courage.  I was armed.  On my belt I carried the weapons of my forefathers...a bubble pipe, a package of red vines, and a rubber mallet.  I was ready to destroy, or be destroyed...<br />  The rabbit saw me and seemed to sense my determination.  It had no head, but I sensed it sneering at me.  With a warbling screech, the rabbit attacked me. It flew to action, attempting to cripple me with a spinning back kick and a flurry of karate chops.  Gasping, I lashed back with my mallet, blowing my bubble pipe fiercely, and landed a hit soundly on the rabbits side.  Before it could recover, I began lashing it with the red vines, leaving bloody welts on its pale, graying flesh. It squealed in pain and squirmed behind a trash can, with me in hot pursuit...<br />  The rabbit unexpectly turned, and I made a grab at the skinny carcass, but it sped past meIt cursed me and fled. With no head, paws or fur, the animal was very streamlined and as fast as greased lightning.  I doggedly pursued it to the edge of town when I lost sight of it...and I was relieved to see that the rabbit did not seem to be turning back.<br />  It seemed that as quickly as it began...the rabbit's rampage was over.  The last time I saw the beast, I had been patrolling the city.  I saw that it was armed with two automatic rifles and strings of ammunition, and it appeared Rambo-esque upon a hill.  It screamed ""Aaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaa!"" and fired the weapons into the air.  It then ran and jumped into a jeep with Charlie Sheen and sped away...<br />  I saw a mushroom cloud form in the distance...<br />  I looked into the sunset, my teeth gritted with determination.  I would survive.  And as god as my witness, I would never be hungry again!<br />  I sit my weary body behind my computer once again, mopping beads of cool sweat from my forehead. I begin write this review. Gingerly, I start to type....""Yes, Virginia, this was a very bad rabbit....""",0
2221,"Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those ""pockets"" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...",1
2222,"My dad started selling these traps in the 1950s. They originally were a treated wood but eventually they would get chewed on by gophers (revenge motivated), stolen by fox, or decayed by weather (forgotten for months). They sold for $3 each or so much a case. In our area a bounty was paid for the tail (today its at $3 each). I had at one time 12 traps and made some good money trapping gophers. Over the years, I've trapped hundreds of the little bastxxs. Why the hatred? Pocket gophers will eat your garden alive, drop 8' Norway pines, ruin your lawn and destroy underground electric wires. What's worse, if you let them be, the fox and badgers will come in to get them and then you'll see what real dirt moving and destruction means. A war zone!<br /><br />This new plastic version works as well and doesn't get damaged by weather but costs significantly more than other open trap types. However, they work better than any other trap I've used as they are easy to set, no wounded gophers (never seen a live one yet)and will get the gopher 4 out of 5 times. That said, here's some observations:<br /><br />1. To find a gopher run, take a pointed steel rod (I have one with a cross handle on the top and a stepping bar on one side toward the bottom). Go around the outside of the latest gopher mound inserting the rod 6-12"" into the ground and about 12"" apart. When the rod ""falls"" through the ground after initial insertion, you've found the tunnel. Take a square head spade and dig a square hole , flat bottom, with the tunnel at either or both ends. (Use two traps or seal one tunnel if your in the middle of a run). Butt the set trap up tight against the tunnel. Lightly cover the top of the trap with dirt (grass over the tiny gaps where the metal parts enter the trap, then dirt). Not too much as it will eventually interfer with the spring strength. Leave the hole open at the end (I've caught many gophers with the air hole closed too, especially if the trap is in a runway - tunnel going both ways).<br /><br />2. You may catch the gopher fairly quick but I leave traps overnight before moving them. If the trap doesn't get tripped after a day, there is a 90% chance its plugged with dirt. If full of dirt, reset. However, each time its plugged, the chance of trapping the gopher (they get smarter each time) is significantly reduced. After plugged twice, your chance of catching him there is near zero. Move the trap to another portion of their maze and try again.<br /><br />3. Wear old, worn gloves so you leave no scent. I've never washed a trap after a dead gopher though.<br /><br />4. To remove a dead gopher, take the box trap, turn it on end over the garbage, hold the spring bar down and shake hard. The gopher will pop out. (A little messy but it works in rural areas...Take the dead gopher and fling him in the middle of the yard. I've never had a gopher still there the next day as many, many other animals love gophers for a decent meal. Is this green or what??)<br /><br />5. Don't settle for just one gopher. I always reset the trap into the same hole and its 50/50 you'll catch another. If you think you have them all, remove the trap and leave the tunnel open. If it fills back up after a day, there's more in the maze.<br /><br />6. Gophers love easy digging so they will follow easy digging directions. Unfortunately underground electric wire make for easy digging and a gopher will follow the wire. For some reason (revenge again?) they will chew on the plastic wire coating as the enjoy the easy digging. Weeks or months later when a wire nick corrodes and when the lights go off, you'll know they were busy.<br /><br />7. If you have fox, coyote or badgers in the area, stake your trap down with chain and an anchor. If not, a predator will gladly remove the dead gopher but unfortunately with your trap. And you'll never see the trap again.<br /><br />8. With minimal care (flag so you don't forget where your traps are and anchor when necessary)these traps will last almost forever. I'm still using an original wood box trap from the 1960s. All beat up but still catches gophers.<br /><br />If catching gophers with minimal effort is the goal, you can't go wrong with this proven box design. Good hunting!",1

This is why many people are ending up with high blood pressure as most of the American diet is full of processed foods full of the (white salt) poison. Himalayan Crystal Salt is very healthy and safe to cook with and helps to balance the body as it is loaded with many trace minerals. It is also more healthy than sea salt.

2233,"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.",1

Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.

I'm a fan of straight PB2 (a spoon by itself) but have had PB2 on crackers, sprinkled on banana/apple slices, and am looking forward to making homemade PB2 ice cream this summer.<br /><br />STORAGE: I was a bit disappointed at shelf life projection.  As a dry product, it should last for years but the company says 10-12 months unopened and 4-6 opened. I would prefer to buy the larger sizes or a case to save more.<br /><br />COST: It can be obtained cheaper elsewhere (like on the PB2 website) but I had free shipping purchases to offset the cost. I wanted to try just one jar before committing to a larger sized container from the company. If you purchase natural products, the price won't be such a shock.<br /><br />BIGGEST PROS: lower calorie and fat content - hands down the best. Dogs like it too ;)<br />BIGGEST CONS: high cost and not a product you can 'make ahead' very successfully (though this could be considered a ""PRO"" because it helps with portion control. I make it as needed.<br /><br />This product will not change your life, but it will satisfy your peanut butter cravings.",1
2240,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.

Also, each pod has a handy paper ""tab"" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a ""best if used by"" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.",1

2248,"This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product ""Wheat Free""? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising.

We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor.

2256,"Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then ""fortified"" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try .

There are peer-reviewed publications in credible scientific journals on the antibacterial properties of Manuka honey - I tried it recently on some road rash from a bike crash and it does work (albeit messy - so you will need good bandages also).  It also goes great in tea for a strong floral flavor.  The only cons might be the expense, but if you use it sparingly it will last quite a while.

The silica works great for drying up odors until it gets pee saturated. I sprinkled at little of the old wet litter on the breeze litter and the cats used it right away.  The pee does drain through and the pads are good, they've used it quite a few times and the pad still feels dry.  I'm actually hoping they DON'T poop in it and continue to use the silica for that, then I'll have the best of both worlds, the poop will dry and the pee will be able to be gotten rid of so the expensive silica will last longer.<br /><br />After a week, still on the first pad and haven't noticed any odor problems.  Have 3 cats and left the silica so they are using both but they are using the breeze a lot.  Adding crystals or enzyme spray to the pad might stretch it's life out even longer.  They've pooped in the breeze too and I haven't noticed a smell but lots of pellets glue tight so I'm losing quite a few each time.  I'm used to the silica, which is much cleaner than clay or clumping and I haven't noticed any increased odor with the breeze.<br /><br />Changed the pad on the 8th day because, well really how far do you want to push it, and no sign of trouble.

For PowerBar, I've tried the Vanilla, which is really delicious. It tastes like cake frosting! However, the vanilla does not have caffeine, so this does not fill my needs. I have tried the Double Latte, which I abhor--I thought it was AWFUL. It just stuck to my teeth and wouldn't go down, and yuck yuck yuck. I love coffee, too. But as a liquid, in a mug! :) I have heard from many runners that they enjoy the Green Apple, so I might try these in the future. The PowerBar brand is a thinner consistency than Gu or Clif, so sometimes I think it goes down a lot easier, especially if you're not near a water fountain or aid station. If the vanilla had caffeine, I would probably stick with that one. I couldn't run the distances I do without gels. I take one on a daily run of 7-8 miles, I'll take 2 gels on a weekend run of 14-16 miles, and I'll take 3 on a run longer than 20 miles (in addition to Clif Bars). I hope this helps someone make a gel decision!<br /><br />Oh, in addition, I want to point out that PowerBar gels are made in a facility that manufactures dairy products, whereas Gu does not.

2265,"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.",1

I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

2274,"This review is for people who are expecting Loma Linda franks to taste like Morningstar and Garden Burger-type frozen veggie dogs.  I bought these expecting them to be quite similiar.  They are not. They are, however, shelf-stable (I got them b/c I'll be overseas and need protein) and very nutritious at only 110 calories each.<br /><br />I just can't seem to get used to the taste and texture -- much softer and more pliable than the frozen variety, with less of a hotdog ""skin"". The taste is pretty different.  Less meaty.  Also, there are 8 per can, so storing the leftovers is a bit inconvenient.<br /><br />I can see how these might be great in a casserole or as part of another dish, but on their own (which is how I ate them), they weren't to my taste.<br /><br />I feel bad giving this product a poor review since it's my own fault for thinking that frozen veggie dogs and shelf stable ones in a can would be the same, but thought I should alert others like me who were unfamiliar with Loma Linda and expecting something comparable to Morningstar's product.",1

The bags fit perfectly, but they seem to start degrading within a few days. If I took out compost every day, it would be fine, but I empty my compost bucket about twice a week. When I lift a bag to take it outside, it is dripping, so I have to take the whole bucket out and scrub it thoroughly afterwards to get rid of the odor. Previously, when I used a regular plastic shopping bag, leakage was almost never a problem, but it is a regular occurance with these liners. I like that the bags are biodegradable, but rather than purchasing these again, I'll probably go back to re-using plastic bags when my supply runs out--unless I find a sturdier brand.

2279,"I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!",1
2280,"After trying every brand on the market, I can say without hesitation Taste Nirvana is the best tasting CW available. And I'm so excited it's now available via Amazon, in a can, and discounted with subscribe and save! I've been purchasing the 9.5 oz glass bottles for many months at $2 ea and found it helped me stay hydrated during the winter (heaters always dry my skin out and make me itchy).

I compared them side by side with the other vita coco I had (the smaller cartons) and these taste really different. I opened a few more to try, and some were okay, and others sour.<br /><br />UGH. I don't care how good some of these boxes are! If they vary this much, it's not worth it to me to try again.<br /><br />*Edited to add:<br />I emailed vita coco and told them about this and they told me they had a bad batch. The rep then mailed me a free box of 12 cartons. This batch was good! (They sent me some funky flavors instead of the original though...still nice of them).",1

2284,"I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info.  I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella).  If you make the kit by following the instructions, it will turn out dry.  I drink dry, but my preference is for a wine to be slightly dry, so I make modifications to the program.<br /><br />I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there. I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida. I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon. I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits. They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine. Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else. We each have our own preferences. I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of [...] to [...] a bottle. And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano. I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies. I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly. If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084. By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better. That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%. Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store). Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling. Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons. To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff. Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption. Cheers.<br /><br />Dec 31, 2010 Update!!!<br /><br />We opened several bottles of the Valpolicella over the holidays.  This is from wine that I made in March 2010.  With every batch, I retain 2 - 5 bottles and let age somewhat.  Usually I drink the rest, beginning immediately after bottling.  The wine is pretty good, even though it is pretty young.  Let me state for the record, this is my preference and everyone's taste is different.  Make/drink what you like, and don't let anyone tell you its wrong...  The Valpolicella that we drank over the holidays had aged about 9 months, and I must say, it was very good. The aging had made a good wine even better.  For the most part, I followed the instructions included in the kit with some additions.  In this batch, I had added 2 lbs of corn syrup and about 1 1/2 cups of black oak chips to the kit at the start of the fermentation process.  The alcohol content, after 2 weeks of fermentation, calculated to be around 14.7%.  A little high, and no doubt due to the added corn syrup.  I racked the wine, clarified and aged it another 4 weeks before bottling.  And when I bottled the wine, I back-sweetened with another 1 lb of corn syrup and added some potassium metabisulfite (1/4 tsp dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to preserve and prevent after-fermentation).  This wine has received the most compliments from family and friends.  I just ordered 2 more kits and will try to replicate the recipe (I keep a wine log of every batch so as to capture the important points of the good, and the bad!).  I hope this helps with your wine making and you enjoy the fruits of the vine as much as I do...  Cheers.  Sam<br /><br />May 2012 Update!!!<br /><br />I have made a couple of changes to the recipe that have been an improvement.  First, I included the recommendation from another review that said to make the kit to only 5 gallons instead of the 6 gallons that the recipe calls for.  Sure, you get 4 less bottles of wine.  But, this improves the fullness of the wine and its finish.  Secondly, I boil 2 - 4 ounces of dark oak chips in a quart of water for 5 minutes. This is then added to the juice and then diluted to the 5 gallon level.  Be sure to let the whole solution cool to 70 - 75 deg F before the yeast is added.  Add the oak chips and all the liquid!  This really improves the flavor, adding a powerful oak flavor that smooths the final wine and improves its overall taste.  I have incorporated both these steps into all the Vino Italiano wine kits.",1

2287,"My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim ""Love it or Hate it""  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.<br /><br />The best preparation I can think of is to mix it thoroughly with butter.  One part Marmite to two or three parts butter.  Then spread thinly on toast.  Served this way, the primary flavor of Marmite is salt.  Then there is a subtle meaty flavor sometimes called umami - it's a flavor that is present in well browned mushrooms or red meat.  The label suggests that it might be put to excellent use in soup stocks as a  substitute or supplement to caramelized roasted vegetables - onions and carrots.<br /><br />As for nutritional value, even spread thinly it is dynamite.  Those who fall hopelessly for its charms may find themselves consuming mega-doses of a few crucial B vitamins.  It is an exceptionally rich source of B12, folicin, and B6.  And since it is free of animal products it is an ideal food to include in a Vegan diet which normally falls short in delivering B12.",1

2294,"These teething biscuits are great, if you HOVER OVER YOUR CHILD THE WHOLE 4 DAYS it takes to eat this mess factory. Holy Crap, my daughter almost needed a Steel Wool pad to get the dried gunk off her body. She had it everywhere, on her nose, in her nose, her eyebrow, her elbow, armpit and legs...plus the high chair needed a pressure washer! I seriously think concrete is mixed in with this recipe. The first time we gave one of these teething jaw-breakers to our daughter we realized we would be up until midnight by the time she finished slurping the brick down. Fortunately, my husband who will eat anything ate it and said it was actually tasty. Kind of like those first generation Power Bars, you know, the ones that tasted like eating your front yard. Needless to say, our daughter did not CHOKE THE FIRST TIME, BUT SHE DID THE NEXT and we have decided that she will not have these anymore, unless they have soaked in a vat of water for three days. These things are so dense they are probably like sea monkeys...they probably expand to the size of our house, so we will soak them in an igloo cooler in the backyard.<br /><br />Still, prior to our daughter choking on these teething bricks we did discover their magical powers. The next morning after her first gnaw session, our daughter was walking, talking and was even potty trained. My husband called me into her room the next morning and to my surprise, there my little 9 month old girl stood there holding her soiled diaper (yes, she undressed herself as well) yelling at my husband how she was sick and tired of having to pee on herself all of the time. We knew right then, the teether had something to do with this. We have been cautious thus far with giving her more since we do not fully understand the powers this biscuit holds! Thinking it would effect adults the same way, my husband bought a case and ate them over the next three days. He did not get smarter, but he has been constipated for the past 3 months and he cannot stop drooling. The second time we provided our daughter with one of these we found her the next morning downstairs watching Good Will Hunting yelling at the screen disproving all mathematical theories presented to the screen.

2295,"East Cape Manuka Honey is incredible! It's fantastic for a variety of uses: 1) a spoonful approx. 20 minutes before meals seems to drastically reduce the chances of suffering gastro-intestinal distress (such as from IBS or other upset); 2) I haven't been sick with any colds or flu since consuming one or more spoonfuls a day even when repeatedly exposed to sick friends, family and co-workers so I believe it boosts the immune system; 3) as a facial or spot treatment vs. acne (adult or teenager), this honey rapidly speeds healing of existing acne and prevention of future outbreaks; it also leaves my skin smooth and tight; 4) as a rapid wound healer, there is nothing better I've found in nature or science. For me, it works faster and better than any OTC antibacterial cream, from reducing pain signals to promoting actual healing. One tiny 2.5 oz. jar lasts me about 4-6 weeks of conservative daily use. The honey has a smoky, somewhat medicinal flavor that isn't very good but isn't bad, either. You get used to it. After all, the results are worth it!<br /><br />Be warned, not all honeys are created equal. Only New Zealand Manuka Honey with a UMF rating is legit because it is tested and certified by the New Zealand government to have the correct ""Unique Manuka Factor"" rating and purity. The reason New Zealand Manuka Honey is so powerful is the bees feast on the New Zealand Manuka tea tree plant (which is ten times more powerful than its Australian cousin). This results in their honey being loaded with antibacterial properties! Because Manuka Honey is rare and expensive, a large number of fakes are available that claim to be ""bio-active"" or ""UMF equivalent"" to whatever UMF number (12+, 15+, etc.). These knock-offs do contain some Manuka Honey but are not 100% pure; they are cut with other honeys which make it cheaper to produce and less effective. Yet many will charge the same price as the real deal for this inferior product hoping customers won't know the difference! I've tested regular store-bought American honey vs. a ""bio-active 15+"" knock-off Manuka Honey vs. the ""real deal"": East Cape Manuka Honey UMF 20+. The American honey had minor benefits, the knock-off Manuka brand offered a clear improvement (2-3 times better than American honey) but was still not strong enough. However, the East Cape UMF 20+ gave me results that were right off the chart!

Apply the honey directly as a spot treatment or all over as a mask once or twice daily and leave on for 30-60 minutes, then wash off with cold water.<br /><br />When I first began using Manuka Honey, I had quick results but like anything, you have to stick with it or the acne comes back. If the honey doesn't get rid of your acne completely (like me, although it did do an amazing job of reducing it), you should also try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DI8K4"">Manuka Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz</a> (again, you should wash first with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V96R1G"">Manuka Honey Propolis Soap</a>), maybe alternating between the oil and the honey masks once each per day (whatever combination works best for you). The oil is even stronger and more concentrated than the honey; some people may find it too strong when applied directly. If this is you, then you can try 2-3 drops diluted in a solution of water and/or witch hazel. The oil is also handy for healing minor wounds like hangnails, paper cuts or cat scratches; I place a drop directly on the wound several times a day and it works like a charm. The only downside to the oil is it has a strong medicinal odor (not awful but not good) so I wouldn't use it right before leaving the house or inviting friends over. It might also sting a little when it first goes on but this should vanish within a few minutes.<br /><br />Note that the higher the UMF rating, the stronger the antibacterial properties. For therapeutic uses such as mentioned above, I wouldn't go with less than UMF 15+ but prefer 20+. Natural Solutions/East Cape makes both and there are other brands that are also UMF-certified but I haven't tried them. All of my Manuka orders have been through Koru Naturals and they have been lightning fast to ship and quick to respond to emails (they've also securely packed my honey each time to avoid breakage in transit). Koru also offers a nice selection of other healthcare items from New Zealand (lanolin, etc.).<br /><br />One final word: I'm not a doctor. I'm not offering medical advice. Different sites offer different treatment suggestions (which I encourage you to read and consider before use). I can't guarantee Manuka will work miracles for you but I know it did for me! Both my MD and naturopath proved  useless in diagnosing or treating my skin problems; problems that had plagued me for nine years. Only Manuka proved effective and I'd tried everything from prescription drugs to diet changes. Your results may vary but if you suffer from any of the problems I've mentioned above and nothing else has worked, you owe it to yourself to at least try Manuka. It changed my life!",1

2303,"I bought one of these and one of the mana potions for fun--was going on a trip to meet up with some friends who would appreciate such items.  Here's what we all pretty much agreed on:<br /><br />Visual:  Small but very attractive packaging.  Pretty much exactly what you might think a health potion would look like in real life based upon many popular games.  Smaller than expected--but then it more easily explains how your character in World of Warcraft, or 'toon, could carry 40 in one backpack.<br /><br />Taste:  Also explains why your 'toon refuses to drink another one for several minutes, even if it means dying.  Dying is preferable as long as you still have the aftertaste.  Think cough syrup, only without the benefit of alcohol or drugs.  Very glad it came in 50ml bottles--one good sized swig and it's gone.  After a short period of time, however, one starts to think it wasn't that bad.  An appropriate support group could probably help with that mild problem.<br /><br />Effects:  Works as advertised per friends who drank it (I drank the mana potion).  They were able to stay up as late as they desired, were able to concentrate well, and noted no adverse effects the next day.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Per their website, contains 25 calories per serving, includes Vitamin C (100% RDA), B1 (80% RDA), B5 (80% RDA), B6 (1600% RDA), B12 (100% RDA) as well as caffeine and enzymes.  Caffeine content roughly equivalent to two Red Bulls or four cups of coffee.<br /><br />Bottom line: Works well, but based upon the caffeine I would not recommend for children or anyone else you wouldn't hand a pot of coffee to and expect them to drink it all.  Really shouldn't be listed in toys and games, but rather with food or energy drinks.",1

2308,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.<br /><br />When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.<br /><br />So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.<br /><br />I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.<br /><br />Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.<br /><br />This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!",1

The four cog-enhancing supp's in 5-hour energy are ""Vit. B-Complex Vitamins, NALT, L-Phenylalanine, Citicoline (CDP-Choline) and Caffeine"".

Taurine, is often floated around as having an effect on cognition, but this has never been shown to be true amongst people I talk to and is more than likely added because some buff dude somewhere read something that said it helps with this and that. It does not, and you're welcomed to do your own research and call me out if you find evidence to the contrary. I gave it 2 stars because I don't ""hate it"", as it does work, but I ""don't like it"" as the cost is such a barrier for many. 2 bucks each? That's insane.<br /><br />In short, do your wallet a favor. Purchase the above 5 listed supplements and take them on an empty stomach and preferably in the morning (NALT will benefit the most from this regimen). Later in the day, you could do the same regimen except split a caff. tab in half so you're not up at 4am thinking about stuff you usually never think about. If you find that this stack is getting you too nervous and you're using it for learning tasks, add an L-theanine to the group and you should be good to go. If you're the knowledge-seeking type, you can also check out Huperzine-A, Alpha-GPC, and 5-HTP, and how they work on the dopaminergic system to see if you want to consider placing them in a rotating nootropic stack (taking them all at once would be a mistake)<br /><br />They're a business, I get it.

However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it.",0

It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness.

2343,"Nature's One deleted my post from their Facebook page so I am posting my doctors recommendations here.<br /><br />If there is any question whether this company is hiding something it was quickly answered after they deleted my post in which I described recommendations that I received from the toxicologists at Environmental Health Sciences at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA.  This department specifically deals with public health issues regarding environmental toxins so I believe their opinions are less biased than that of Natures One or their ""independent researchers.""<br /><br />Anyway, I have been feeding my baby this formula since she was born 5 months ago.  I was concerned after hearing the news report regarding the levels of inorganic arsenic in the brown rice syrup so I called my local pediatrician who recommended that I call Children's Hospital.  The toxicologist recommended that I stop using any formula that contains brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient along with any other baby food products with it until they have more information. He mentioned the Dartmouth study stating the brown rice syrup has well over the recommended amount of inorganic arsenic, about 6x times past the limit.<br /><br />It was a relief to hear from the toxicologist that I need not worry about any acute or chronic arsenic toxicity for my baby, and that she does not require any urine, blood or hair tests.  This is in contrast to what many other pediatricians have recommended for their parents who are feeding their children the same formula.  The toxicologist believes that my daughter's risks to developing any illness, cancer etc was less than 1% greater than a child who had not been given the formula, so that was very reassuring.<br /><br />After hearing these recommendations from Children's Hospital I could see how someone would still continue using the Natures One product because the health risks are low, however I opted to switch because I realize my role as a parent is to reduce any risks to my child, even if it is less than 1%. There are so many other chemical risks out there that I feel any risks that you can take off the table would help protect my child because it is probably the cumulative effect off all these chemicals that leads to adverse problems. And i figure if those people who have a Masters in Public Health are recommending to discontinue it who am I to disagree with them.<br /><br />An ethical company would have taken the Dartmouth study information and told the public that they will try to improve on their product, ie. reduce the inorganic arsenic, however, they still claim they make the finest baby formula out there.  Their website says they are looking out for the health of our children but refuse to recall or change their product which speaks for itself.<br /><br />In light of them deleting my post above from their Facebook page, it appears that they definitely have something to hide, as I was just posting public health information that I felt people in my situation would like to know given to me by one of the most reputable health institutions (Children's Hospital) in the world.<br /><br />Obviously, I would give this product zero stars if I could.  Hope this info helps some of those confused, concerned parents out there like me.<br /><br />UPDATE #1*** please read the article from the Huffington Post written Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist from Yale.  It is in line with the recommendations from Children's Hospital of Boston.<br /><br />UPDATE #2*** I received a response from Dr. Gary Ginsburg in response to the new testing results by Nature's One.  Looks like their testing results indicate an even worse situation than originally thought.  Here is the response from Dr. Ginsburg: ""Seeing your comment made me hopeful that this is just lab error, a false alarm. However, saying that Dartmouth doesn't know how to measure arsenic is like saying Roger Federer doesn't know how to play tennis. The Nature's One press release sounded scientific - they explain how the Dartmouth analysis was different from their method and why theirs was better. But when you click on their own results - in 3 samples of their baby formula, the inorganic arsenic is actually greater (53 to 83 ppb) than the Dartmouth results (10-20 ppb)!! So calling the Dartmouth results too high and flawed is an insult to Dartmouth as well as to all of us. Further, they compare their results to an outmoded WHO (CODEX) arsenic acceptable intake of 2.1 ug/kg/d. This was withdrawn in the latest CODEX because it was too close to the cancer effect level and CODEX did not supply a new value. Nature One claims that Dartmouth relied on the 2.1 ug/kg/d value but in fact Dartmouth used 0.3 ug/kg/d (the dose corresponding to USEPA's drinking water std) to compare against. If Nat1 used that target, their baby formula would be in the danger zone, so they chose the withdrawn target instead. The bottom line is that the company's own data make the situation worse, with levels of arsenic in their baby formula 5 to 8 times greater than the USEPA drinking water standard for inorganic arsenic (10 ppb).""",1

""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""<br /><br />Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.<br /><br />Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.<br /><br />A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.<br /><br />Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.<br /><br />Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".<br /><br />A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.<br /><br />Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.<br /><br />Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.<br /><br />Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.",1
2349,"I've had several of the brothers all natural products and purchased several cases after reading that they are a company in western ny. I liked supporting what I assumed was a small business operating in a big apple growing area of the country. It turns out that they just repackage a product that comes to them from china. I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you, they do taste good but if you're concerned with the huge amounts of less safe pesticides used in china and with the questionable quality of chinese food products then steer clear.",1

The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been ""babying"" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else.

Cleaning is most easily done by inserting the end of a funnel -- or sausage stuffer attachment -- into one end and *slowly* running warm water through the entire length, unraveling and untwisting as needed. This should be performed at least twice.<br /><br />Since we'd known to do that, we had no problems whatsoever with these casings.

2362,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter!

2365,"I have 4 cats ranging in age from 2-10 years old.  We previously fed them Iams Multi-Cat dry food which we purchased in 20lb bags at our local warehouse store.  About 4 months ago, the warehouse store discontinued stocking Iams cat food, so I went looking for another, better quality dry cat food that was reasonably priced (my preference was to make my own cat food, but the reality is that I don't have time to do so).<br /><br />I stumbled on Castor & Pollux on Amazon & decided to give the blue bag (adult feline) a try.  We've now gone through 27lbs of the adult feline dry food and like the Castor & Pollux dry food enough to make this our cat food of choice (so I have to remember to order ahead of time to not run out).  We are now trying the green bag (indoor cat), so that review will come later after we go through a bag or 2 (15lb bags).<br /><br />Since it is not listed, and I wanted to know this information before I purchased, here is a full List of ingredients straight from the back of the blue bag:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Menhaden Fish Meal, Ground Whole Grain Barley, Oat Groats, Brewers Rice, Chicken Fat preserved with Mixed Tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), Salmon Meal, Dried Egg Product, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Potatoes, Cultured Whey, Dried Carrots, Dried Bananas, Dried Apples, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ground Flaxseed, Sodium Bisulfate, Potassium Choloride, Salt, Dried, Blueberries, Dried Papya, Choline Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (source of Vitamin C), Zinc Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Oxide, Copper Sulfate, Niacin, Vitamin A Supplement, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganous Oxide, Thiamine Mononitrate (source of Vitamin B1), Riboflavin Supplement (source of Vitamin B2), Pyridoxine Hydroxcholoride (source of Vitamin B6), Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin K1 Supplement, Sodium Selenite, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Cobalt Caronate, Yeast Culture (Saccharomyes Cerevisiae), Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophuilus Fermentation Product, Dried Aspergillus Niger Fermentation Extract, Dried Trichoderma Longbrachiatum Fermentation Extract, Dried Bacillus Subtilis Fermentation Extract and Fermentation Solubles.<br /><br />My older cats (8 & 10 yrs) had a hard transition from the Iams.  We cleaned up a lot of carrot-filled cat vomit for the first 2 weeks.  The younger cats transitioned with no issues whatsoever.  We have since gone to the indoor feline and are not experiencing the daily upchucking (whether this is because they are already accustomed to the food or not, I don't know, but would assume that it plays a part).  All cats love the food.  We did find that they eat a little less of the Castor & Pollux, so maybe they are getting more quality with each bite.  Iams uses by-product and Cator & Pollux uses meal, so I assume this may be the case.<br /><br />I did research on by-product vs meal & found the following information from various websites:<br /><br />Protein, in the form of quality meat ingredients, is the most important component of a pet's diet. As animals with a carnivorous background, their digestive tract is designed to utilize primarily meat and fat. It is also the most expensive ingredient for a manufacturer to buy and the profit margin on a product is drastically affected by the amount and quality used. Ideally, the first ingredient of a food should be either a specified meat meal, or a specified fresh meat type followed by a meal.<br /><br />Meat sources in ""meal"" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. ""Meal"" consists of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but remember that meats in their original, ""wet"" form still contain up to 75% water.<br /><br />Byproducts of any type are less desirable and only acceptable if they do not make up the main source of animal protein and if the name of the species used is also defined in some manner (e.g. ""chicken byproducts"" or ""beef byproducts"" but not ""meat byproducts"" or ""poultry byproducts""). Byproducts consist of anything but the quality cuts of meat.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux has a Pet & Soul Foundation that supports various pet organizations & charities.  Look on their website & do the daily free kibble game to donate free kibble to pet shelters.<br /><br />All in all, I think that I could probably come up with a better homemade cat food, but, given time constraints and solid know-how, I think that this Caster & Pollux dry food is a good choice.  My cats, all indoors, love the food, their fur is shiny & their skin appears to be healthy.  We do not have dander issues & all the cats seem to be feisty & healthy.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced dry food with a good list of ingredients as compared to other commercial foods. Castor & Pollux claim that they fully & unconditionally guarantee their food, so if you order & don't like it, you can call them.<br /><br />Best of all, Amazon ships it to my doorstep.  RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />10/3/11 (EDIT): I am still feeding my cats this food & they are doing well.  I now supplement with a little wet cat food (have tried many brands/varieties & a still trying to find a ""hit"") daily, but the majority of their diet is this Castor & Pollux kibble.",1
2366,"My hope is that someday amazon starts adding the ingredients to these products.

2374,"Ito En Sencha Shot is a very decent product and a nice departure from the current run of energy drinks. Following the wildfire success of Red Bull, company after company has come up with energy drinks involving high concentrations of caffeine and taurine. Caffeine has known long-term effects on health, while taurine has barely been studied.<br /><br />Sencha Shot is a refreshing departure from the common approach to sports/energy drinks. Instead of loading it with strange things that produce a big lift in the drinker's feelings of overall physical energy, Sencha shot takes a milder and much more sensible approach giving the drinker a quick dose of chilled green tea with some vitamin C added, offering the *positive* health effects of the green tea's antioxidant properties. To put that another way, in comparison with other ""proper"" energy drinks like Red Bull, Amp, MDX, Rock Star etc, etc, drinking Sencha Shot is a lot less like getting hit with a hammer.<br /><br />Now it's true that you could for all intents and purposes get all the effects of Sencha Shot by brewing a big pot of decent-quality green tea, and then eating an orange, but it wouldn't be portable and you'd look very strange if you offered it to someone.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the most I can tell you about it is that I like it. It's good and good for you and it's not expensive. In fact, when bought by the case, on a per-can basis, it costs around half what Starbuck's doubleshot espresso does and there's not a thing wrong with it.

I may be the only person to experience this and realize it may be some kind of allergy to some product in this drink.",0
2377,"I buy this brand from a local store in bulk.  I was trying to save myself some time and hassle by buying it through Amazon (about same price either way as my local store).  But after this shipment (and a totally separate different food item shipped from Amazon *on the same order* that also had health/quality issues), I cannot recommend buying this from Amazon.<br /><br />I was sent the case pack, wrapped in heavy plastic which was packaged neatly in a cardboard box.  When I pulled out the plastic-wrapped case, it was extremely obvious that these cans had burst... and had done so some time ago b/c an enormous amount of black mold had grown inside the plastic wrap.  Why this wasn't caught by their people, I don't know.  (I'm on ""prime""; so, I get my shipments in 2 days or less...not enough time to have the mold grow that much.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did open the plastic surrounding the case of cans to inspect further.  I found that at least 4 cans had burst, and, of course, the stench was horrible.  I tossed the entire batch in the garbage.  There was no way I was chancing my family's health on this one.<br /><br />NOTE: (1) This item was fulfilled by Amazon, not a different seller.  (2) The boxes in which these were shipped was not damaged, not even a small dent.  (3) The cans were not dented, either.  This case was not damaged during shipment.  Whatever caused the cans to burst appears to be the result of an error during ""Farmer's Market"" manufacturing.  Furthermore, my assertion is that Amazon's people should have noticed the obvious black mold.<br /><br />[Edited to add: Initially (and after talking briefly with a doctor/scientist about these cans), I was given the impression that the burst cans were a result of botulism.  The scientist is the one who used that term with me b/c it had not occurred to me prior to the conversation.  Alarmed, I used the term in my original review w/o referencing the aforementioned conversation.  I have since removed the term.  Regardless, black mold is toxic (more so than green molds), and this experience was health and safety issue.]<br /><br />I will say that Amazon did give me my money back without a major hassle.<br /><br />In my experience WRT household/grocery items, it appears that Amazon gets good pricing from companies for stuff that doesn't meet that company's upper level quality control standards.  Besides all the great books, toys, electronics and more, I order several household items from Amazon.  Most of the items in this ""household/grocery"" category aren't edible/food items. I do notice minor differences in quality on these other household items.  For the most part, I can overlook them.  But on food?  No way.<br /><br />(To be clear: Other items such as books, electronics, toys have usually been just fine.)<br /><br />To sum up, when I say ""tread warily"" I'm suggesting that you just be careful and pay closer attention than you otherwise would when you order this (and perhaps other food items) from Amazon.<br /><br />Your experience may vary, and I hope it does.",1
2378,"In my never-ending search to find odd, unusual and inexpensive beauty products I have finally found ""COCONUT OIL""!!!<br /><br />I read a beauty book recently <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892349"">Can You Get Hooked on Lip Balm?: Top Cosmetic Scientists Answer Your Questions about the Lotions, Potions and Other Beauty Products You Use Every Day</a> that claimed that natural, organic, cold pressed coconut oil was the only oil that could actually penetrate the hair shaft. It seems all other oils, including mineral, olive, and sunflower can only coat the hair, at best a temporary cure.<br /><br />What makes coconut oil special? Its about 90% saturated fatty acid which contains about 40% lauric acid. Among it's almost mythical and magical properties it is ""reputed"" to cure a host of maladies including high cholesterol, obesity, infections,(all highly doubtful)and dry hair and skin (believable). It is also a food product that can be used as a butter substitute a shortening and a frying oil. My interest, however, is hair, just hair.<br /><br />Interestingly, coconut oil solidifies at temperatures under 76 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an air conditioned home in a temperate climate, this oil will be solid most of the time. I decanted a few teaspoons into a small container from the wide jar the product comes in. I keep the original container in the refrigerator and the small one in the bathroom where it is usually much warmer than the rest of my house.<br /><br />When liquefied, this oil is fairly thick and milky looking. It smells deliciously of coconut. To me it tastes of .... coconut grease....but not in a totally bad way.<br /><br />To use this as a hair conditioner one needs to start slowly and experiment. Although my hair is thick it has a fairly fine texture. The first few times I used the oil I over applied it and my hair became flat and greasy looking.<br /><br />As a hair conditioner, it is recommended to coat your dry hair and scalp with the oil, cover your head with a towel and let it penetrate for an hour or two. Using non-conditioning shampoo, apply a small amount to your dry hair and rub it in without adding any water at first. Then, after the shampoo has been rubbed in, add small amounts of warm water until you build up a lather. Rinse, then shampoo again normally. Your hair will be very soft and smooth.<br /><br />As a hair dressing, use only a very tiny amount unless your have thick, very curly or kinky hair. I gave a friend with long thick curly hair some of the oil and she is completely in love with it.<br /><br />A little of this product goes a very long way. A jar should last a very long time. Besides, if you don't like it as a hair product, you can always eat it!",1

2382,I am a recovering scientist and lab rat so my thoughts on this product may be warped but here goes.  Splenda (sucralose + formulation aides) is approximately 8 times sweeter than plain sugar on a cup by cup basis. A cup of Splenda contains 96 calories. Table sugar as sold in the US contains 770 calories per cup. In the US a sweetener with less than 5 calories per teaspoon is allowed to be called zero calories.  Thus the normal Splenda formulation with 2 calories per teaspoon can be called zero calories and if you notice all the calorie information for splenda is based on a per teaspoon basis even if you are using a train hopper car amount to take advantage of the 2 calories per teaspoon equals 0 calories loophole. When you buy the Splenda Sugar blend formulation what do you get??? You get roughly 28 ounces of sugar and roughly 4.5 ounces of Splenda equivalent. Retail sugar goes for roughly 50 cents per pound so $1 for the sugar and retail Splenda probably 75 cents per ounce so in total retail value of the blend is $4.00-$4.50.  Therefore it must be assumed that the value of measuring sugar and Splenda separately is roughly $2-$3 per package.  As I said convenient but pricey.,1

This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving.<br /><br />Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too.<br /><br />Bonito flakes, called ""hanakatsuo"" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice.

2393,"Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!<br /><br />The sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate, but since it's 600x as sweet as sugar, they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar. But all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates.<br /><br />This could really screw up somebody on Atkins' Induction phase.  For example, the day before I learned this, I made some Kool-Aid with Splenda.  I didn't know that in 2 quarts I was drinking down 24 carbs!<br /><br />What to do?  Find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose.  They use water as the filler, it's super-concentrated still, and it truly has 0 carbs.  I look forward to the day when McNeil Nutritionals meets the demand for ZERO-carb Splenda.  (That's 0.0g, not 0.49g!)",1

2395,"I was reluctant to buy this product because of all the bad reviews and I thought maybe all the good reviews were put there by the families of the team who concocted this product. Just the other day, my co-worker gave me a chocolate brownie made with erythritol and I enjoyed it and I waited for a weird aftertaste and I waited for any laxative effect. Neither. I was the grocery store today and I picked up some sugar-free Oreos and then I saw this bottle of sugar-free Hershey's chocolate syrup and then I instantly thought back to all these reviews.<br /><br />  As a lowcarber, I use stevia in my soy milk, my hemp milk, my tea and my coffee. I think stevia is TERRIBLE with chocolate. All the chocolate products out there are usually made with maltitol and sucralose mix, which I do enjoy. So, if there was such a product out there like this, I would buy it. I don't have the explosive diarrhea or upset stomach or other related episodes that other people have with maltitol. Maybe they consume A LOT more than I, or maybe I'm special. Having tried recently the chocolate brownie, I thought what the heck.<br /><br />  I mixed in three teaspoons of syrup into my soy milk and I absolutely thought it was GREAT AND DELICIOUS! Those naysayers were exaggerating! The flavor was not as sweet as I expected, but that's okay since most commercial products are way too sweet, just like the sugar-free chocolates on the market. So, I thought it was genius that it was just sweet enough. And when you go low carb, everything starts to taste too sweet and obnoxious after awhile.<br /><br />  I did notice a slight bitter aftertaste that was not attributable to natural chocolate. The bitterness was fleeting and not unpleasant, so I didn't mind it. The lingering taste in my mouth is a slightly sweet chocolate, not a chemical taste. The aftertaste didn't taste natural though, so if you're the organics-only type, then you should not buy it.<br /><br />  I was ready to side with all the five-star-raters but I wanted to be sure, so I took a teaspoon of chocolate syrup and ate it straight. All of a sudden, all the one-star-raters were right: it was sour!!! So, these people were right too! It tastes terrible out of the bottle.<br /><br />  So, I say this to all of you, if you are a lowcarber or a diabetic and you're looking for a chocolate treat in the form of a drink like chocolate milk, for example (though milk has carbs so why would you want to drink milk? Add it to unsweetened soy milk or hemp milk), then by all means get this. It's great. Whatever you do, don't be tempted to eat it or pour it down your throat. Otherwise, you will think it's gone bad and you will throw out a treasure and close your world off to sugar-free chocolate syrups forever.<br /><br />  Sure, Hershey is trying to make money out of an increasingly hard niche market to cater to, but at least they know about you and your needs and are trying to make you happy. I thank Hershey's for that. So, give this product a chance. And until they come out with an organic, carb-free, non-diarrhea-inducing syrup with a pleasant aftertaste and mouth feel, this is a compromise I can deal with. I hope you will try it and see the value in a product like this.",1

After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)",0

2401,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",1

2404,"Overall, I cannot recommend this machine.<br /><br />The machine made excellent espresso for the first few weeks we had it.  Once it was broken in, the espresso was average, and the crema was more of a large-bubbled foam.  The grinder is able to create a fine grind, but unfortunately the machine can't pass any water through it, so you have to use a mid-level fine grind.  The machine is able to adjust the amount of water used per shot, but anything more than the smallest available setting creates, well, coffee.  Not even an Americano, just coffee.<br /><br />After three months the grinder broke.  When I opened up the machine's door a broken part flew out.  Amazon sent me a new one.  One month in on the new one, the brewgroup jammed.  I thought it was broken, but after four days, the machine was able to pry itself loose.  Ground coffee was all over the brewgroup, as if it had exploded.  We'll see how it works out.<br /><br />A bright spot--Amazon was astoundingly helpful and gracious.

2405,"Holy Mother of God.<br /><br />I experienced this affront to all five senses via my girlfriend, who had, admirably, attempted to use an enviro-friendly product to collect her cat's bodily excretions. While it may or may not be friendly to the outdoors, it fails horrifically as a cat litter.<br /><br />1. Clumping. If, by ""clumping,"" you mean ""forms a heavy, dough-like glutenous paste,"" you have found your litter. The back of the box, where Calvin piddles, was instantly and constantly filled with a reeking, lava like mudslide, of such dense and sticky consistency that it was nearly impenetrable to a standard scoop, and clung tenaciously to the wall of the box. It was like making a modeling clay from heavy sand, flour, and corn syrup. Two scoops valiantly gave their lives trying to pry this nightmare from it's perch.<br /><br />2. Odor. Now, let's establish something. I have a high tolerance for messes. I've worked in food service, hauling Summer-ripened bags of trash, half food waste, half cashew-sized maggots, dribbling their secretions across the floor, me, and anyone unfortunate enough to get near, for a period of years. Not my fondest memories, but I dealt, heck, I got a kick laughing at my fellow employees if their constitution prevented them from lending a hand.<br /><br />That said, this product generates a hellish stench. The box was scooped daily, or nearly so. I have no idea how the cat stayed in their long enough to commit his excretory functions. The smell of urine and ammonia battered my nose like a pro boxer built from pee. Of course, given the sludgy consistency (see #1), I was doomed to enjoy this assault for several minutes at an eye-watering stretch.<br /><br />The pee smell, however, was only the tip of the stinky iceberg.<br /><br />Ever gotten sick from over-eating, or maybe a plate of food gone bad? Say, for example, lobster. Dinner's over, you're thinking ""mmm, tasty, butter-soaked, sweet lobster meat,"" when suddenly, your entire digestive tract is pummeled by several MMA expert bacteria strains, and you spend four hours in the bathroom, as your stomach competes with your large intestine in a race to wring out to total vacancy. The worst part: the overwhelming taste and smell of the digestive-fluid washed tainted lobster is clearly identifiable as your original meal, the sweet, greasy meat now blended with bile and the overwhelming aroma of your failing bowel. That will be the last lobster you order for a decade or two. This isn't a derail, there's a point upcoming:<br /><br />2(a). The odor. Just the stench of urine fertilized by wheat byproducts would be unbearable, but the olfactory insult to injury is that this is, in fact, wheat. You know, the stuff they make bread, noodles, pizza and so on from. The smell of raw, warm dough is comprehensively integral with the overall stench of this ghastly substance. Imagine for a moment, you came across a bread recipe: 2 cups flour, 1tsp sugar, 1 package of yeast, and 1 cup of warm cat urine. Mix well, and place in a warm oven to rise. Now, hover your head 10"" over the bowl, while you exert yourself mightily trying to pry a silicon putty-like mass from the wall of a litter box without shattering your last litter scoop, your elevated respiration drawing the deadly waft of rancid bread into the base of your lungs with each gagging gasp. Good times.<br /><br />3. Everything else. It's absorbency is poor. A side effect of the piss-poor clumping is that the liquid waste spreads around, tying up a massive amount of litter. Price. Yay! It cost far more than regular litter to begin with, and you toss out half the box every day? Where do I sign? Dust. Fortunately, after scarring your sinuses with yeasty ammonia, powdered chaff is almost pleasant. Tracking. No advantage over regular litter.<br /><br />Avoid this trash, you are better off not keeping a box, and let your pets do what they will.

The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry.<br /><br />Since conception, I have been in love with tea, but ""the Prince"" was my first fine tea. I have still not recovered from the episode in which my father-in-law-to-be proved to me that bag tea was a crime against humanity. And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it's still my favourite.<br /><br />Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it's flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too.<br /><br />Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I've had, this one is the clear winner. I've gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion.<br /><br />My only reservation is this; once you've entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn't it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France?

2421,"I have been gluten free for several years, and I generally don't even attempt to eat bread anymore, even the gluten free kinds.<br /><br />When we discovered that gluten seemed to really affect my autistic son, we had to come up with something for lunches for school.<br /><br />This mix had good reviews so I decided to try it. I have a dedicated gluten free breadmaker that was a gift.<br /><br />With a little toying, I was able to program my machine correctly for the bread. The first loaf I made was underdone in the middle, so I increased the baking time by five minutes for the second one. It wasn't a total loss, because I put the underdone pieces in a buttered skillet and fried them until they were done in the middle.<br /><br />You will need to choose the lightest crust setting you have and change it so there is only one rise time for the bread. Also, while the bread is mixing (it mixes for about five minutes or so), push the mix down on the sides with a rubber spatula about halfway through mixing. This only takes a minute. Now that my machine is programmed, all I have to do is hit the button, come back in about three or four minutes to push down the sides, and then in an hour I have a loaf of bread.<br /><br />As all gluten free bread, it will fall apart a bit if you cut it while still warm. The best way to do it is to make the bread, unmold it onto a paper plate, wrap it in plastic, and put it in the refrigerator. When it is cold it is much easier to cut with the bread knife. Also do NOT cut the whole loaf ahead of time or it will dry out within a couple of days.<br /><br />The bread tastes fabulous. There is milk contained within the mix, so it's not good for gluten free casein free people. I gave a fresh slice of it to a friend who is NOT gluten free and he thought it tasted great. I'll never buy store bought loaves of gluten free bread again, though. This tastes a hundred times better!",1

Today I still use the honey all the time before and after intercouse with the hubby, so if any skin breaks it will heal pretty fast and prevent another ulcer or just help with the pain.

I have used stevia for 3 years now and have always had good, but not great stevia. Higher quality stevia, more pure that is, doesnt give that aftertaste of bitter liquorish. I didn't taste that at all in this stevia, and I definitely looked for it. Could be the flavoring they add to this, but either way the aftertaste isnt there. In my ""research"" I found out that SweetLeaf and NuNaturals have some of the highest concentrations of stevioside in them, meaning more sweet and less sour (the point of a sweetener...). If you like this flavour go with it, if not choose another. Either way you will be happy. Just a note, the flavor is there, but is slight, don't expect much with it in something like coffee, though one of the reviews on here talks about using it in seltzer water.

2438,"I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.",1

No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.

She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.

What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.

2449,"Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!",1

(Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky.",1

2452,"Ok, I know this is an organic grain product but flavor has to count for something.  This stuff is like eating little chunks of wood.  It has no flavor whatsoever.

I honestly will say, though, that it does have an earthy quality. It may take the uninitiated some getting acquainted with--just a little! If trying for the first time, I heartily recommend trying the Hemp Goddess Supreme recipe on the jar's label. Surprisingly palatable! You'll be proud to have done something nourishing and healthy for yourself. Easy to digest. The powder is indeed rather coarse. When you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal, you won't mind. Including this in one's eating habits can only be an addition for the positive.",1

2457,"A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations.  I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history.  The first two days, I only noticed a few of them.  Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently.  I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats).  It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up.  I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms.  But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling.  Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless.  That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever.  I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress).<br /><br />But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal).  So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product.  I paid $18 for 4 ounces!  I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently.  The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before.  The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned.  I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium!<br /><br />Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log!  It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious.  I am truly thankful to have found this product!",1

2461,"As a German, I cannot live without this oil. Try cooked carrots with a pinch of sugar and this oil. Do not fry or cook with it, just add it plenty AFTER cooking. The aroma is a dream, and it tastes grandious!!<br /><br />Unfortunately amazon is not making any effort in protecting the metal cans. I ordered 3 cans in a set and one book at the same time. Now imagine, they just packed the book in a box and put the oil cans on top. That's all! No packing material, no stuffing, nothing! A box with 3 oil cans in it plus a book.<br /><br />Imagine how that book looked like. It had been roughed up by the metal cans rubbing on it during the 10 days of shipping! And all 3 cans had bendings in the outside. I was glad I still had 2 old cans left from last time, so I could refill the oil into the old cans.<br /><br />If I had a chance to buy this oil somewhere else, I absolutely would, but unfortunately I have not found any other place yet.

2462,"I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.<br /><br />When my wife came home, I mentioned to her how I was ripped off by the Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and, in fact, were barely edible.  My wife picked up the empty packet, looked at it for a moment, and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair.  ""You idiot,"" she said, ""these seeds are for planting.""  She then clobbered me with an antique, oak coat tree.  ""I don't know why I ever married you,"" she continued, ""you are always doing stupid, embarrassing things, and no matter how hard I hit you, you never learn.""  She then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis.<br /><br />Maybe I had gotten a bad batch of seeds.  I think I will order them again, and the next time, the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors, or someone is going to get a beating!",0
2463,"I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with ""side effects"" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!",1

Finally running low and had been looking to replace it for about a year. Contacted the company directly and was told their export agent would contact me. Never heard anything. Decided to search web again and was surprised to see Amazon was now selling it.<br />For those that have bought this brand in Mexico and are looking to buy more, this is not the same vanilla!! Might be same company but not nearly as good as the product I got in Cozumel. Much thinner and not as much flavor. I am sure the FDA has a lot to do with it. My rating above reflects this. For those that haven't tried the original, you might love this product. But if you have, you will disappointed in this product as I was.",1

2468,"I received this as a gift at Christmas and have been enjoying using it.  Its very convenient and keeps all the cleanup contained in one bowl.<br /><br />Best feature - the food processor is _very_ powerful and I don't need to strain foods b/c there are no chunks (I do strain peas to remove shells after processing).<br /><br />The steamer is quick and efficient.  With the steamer basket full, I make about one-week worth of single-ingredient food at a time.  I peel foods and cut into chunks before I steam them.  Holds about 2 small sweet potatoes or two pears or one bag of frozen peas.<br /><br />I store foods frozen in silicone mini-muffin pans (much easier to remove than from an ice-cube tray).<br /><br />This device can be used to defrost food - just pop the frozen food in a small heat-proof bowl first.  But, unless you keep a close eye and check a few times, the food gets way too hot.  Easier to use the microwave for 30 seconds, then stir well to make sure there are no hot or cold spots.<br /><br />I will definitely use this when our baby starts to eat our food and it needs to be blenderized first.  The blade and motor on the food processor are fabulous and better than others we have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The price is way too expensive.  I received it as a gift, but would not have bought it for myself.<br />- The spatula is useless, a small silicone spatula is much better.",1

I think that this company's large cartons (half gallon) of organic almond milk have more almonds than sugar, but unfortunately these small cartons seem to not be made of organic almonds, and, more importantly to me, seem to hardly be almond milk at all, but rather water and sugar with some almond flavoring (according to the ingredients list).  Also, they add ""other natural flavorings"" which I try to avoid because usually that's food-industry-speak for msg and stuff like that, which gives me headaches.  I understand that the company wants to make this drink more palatable to children and to reluctant health-nuts, but I think it's the wrong way to go to put more sugar than almonds in it, and the wrong way to go to add all kinds of ""flavoring"" when almonds are so beautifully flavored on their own.

Reading the ingredients on the Skippy jar, I realized there was added sugar and hydrogenated oils. I admit, I have a sweet tooth, but the amount of sugar added here must be used to cover up the filler. You're getting less actual peanut butter and more oil and sugar than other brands. I really liked the taste of the Earth Balance much better as Skippy tasted like candy (which is prob why kids prefer it). Pass on this junk food and ween yourself off the sugar intake.

This is the same stuff that can cause headaches, muscle contractions, chest pain, mood swings, and insomnia in many people. The Truth in Labeling people have been arguing about this for years.  If you look at the picture, there is a asterisk next to ""No Added MSG*"". In the fine print they say: ""*Other than that which naturally occurs in the hydrolyzed proteins and yeast extract"".  The truth is they put this crap in there to increase the glutamate content.<br /><br />So while I recommend that we all eliminate our intake of MSG, those of you that are already doing so, don't get duped by the labeling.<br /><br />For more information see <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173309"">In Bad Taste: The Msg Symptom Complex : How Monosodium Glutamate Is a Major Cause of Treatable and Preventable Illnesses, Such As Headaches, Asthma, Epilepsy, heart</a><br /><br />and: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0929173252"">Excitotoxins: The Taste That Kills</a><br />this review was originally posted on my website.",0

Just add boiling or very hot water and you can easily eat it at your desk as it takes up about as much space as a large coffee mug. Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet.

2495,"I love PB and can't eat it at all during my cutting phases because I tend to eat way too much of it and go over my calorie and fat limit for the day.  (It's great for getting the correct ratio of healthy fats into your diet for bulking phases though!)  I've tried other PB substitues like Better 'N Peanut Butter and PB2(PB2 is a powdered peanut butter mix with about 1/4 the calories and fat of regular PB, and it tastes just like the normal stuff) and they are not bad.  But I still can't eat as much of it as I want.<br /><br />As soon as I saw this, my first thought was ""SWEET!!! THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE GOOD!""  I read some reviews, thought for 25 seconds, ordered 3 jars, and didn't really have too high of expectations since it is a calorie free product.<br /><br />Well, it kind of tastes like roasted peanuts... kind of.  I'd say it's more of a fake sugar/bitter coffee/peanut flavored pudding product.  If you can imagine the aftertaste you get from the fake sugar in diet coke, you can kind of imagine this.<br /><br />It's not a total failure though, because I am still going to use this, but not by itself.  I tried mixing a few tablespoons of this with a tablespoon of regular creamy PB and a little bit of PB2 powder.  The normal PB enhances the peanut taste where this stuff left off, and the PB2 gives it the right texture.  After all that, it's really not bad.  I'd even say pretty good.  Regular PB has about 100 calories per tablespoon and a ton of fat.  This mixed PB concoction has maybe 25 calories per tablespoon.  Not bad.<br /><br />The walden farms grape jelly is great, and does taste like real jelly.  And I'll use it with the peanut butter mix on light wheat bread, and you have a fairly good 200 calorie PB&J sandwich (that's 1/4 the calories and fat of a normal PB&J).",1
2496,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day!

2497,"I have fed this food to several of my dogs for years now with no problems.  About a month ago, all the dogs on this food developed chronic smelly diarrhea.  I couldn't believe it was the food since I'd fed it for years.  After $500 in vet fees I pulled the food as a last resort.  Sure enough, all dogs recovered in two days (after two weeks of problems).  I tried feeding it again to my ""Mr RockGut"" dog (the one who can eat anything).  The next morning he was back to runny stinky stools.<br /><br />I went to Solid Gold's website to check for any recalls and found that as of January 2010, all dry food production for the western states had been moved from their CA plant to their MO plant.  This was our first bag of food from the MO plant.  You can verify that by visiting Solid Gold's website and clicking the ""News"" link at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />If your pup is on this (or any other Solid Gold dry dog food) and suddenly develops stinky smelly feces, SUSPECT THE FOOD FIRST!!!  Don't waste $500 in vet fees like I did.<br /><br />Oh... by the way... an email requesting more information on our particular bag of Barking at the Moon went unanswered from Solid Gold.<br /><br />If they had warned us in advance of the changes, it would have saved us a bunch of money.<br /><br />We're off ALL Solid Gold products.",1

2499,"Just to clear up some confusion here is the quote from the manufacture's website:<br /><br />""Baby's Only Organic簧 Dairy-based Toddler Formula contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), the fatty acid precursors for Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Arachidonic acid (ARA).""<br /><br />Conversion of ALA and LA by the body to the more active longer-chain metabolites is inefficient: 2-5% for DHA.  So while adding ALA to your child's diet is helpful it is not a complete substitute for the ARA and DHA found in breast milk (of course no formula can match breast milk).<br /><br />If you want to use this brand of formula you should consider adding DHA and ARA some other way.  This same company makes a supplement called ""Baby's Only Essentials簧 DHA & ARA"" and there are others on the market.",1

2509,"--+My Order+--<br />Put my order in June 15th, plant arrived at my door on June 20th, with most of that time being spent in ""preparing to ship"" status.  Once it did ship, it got here very quickly.  Good sized chunk of cactus too.  Overall it was probably around 15 inches long, potted in good sandy soil that was still moist, good and green.  I immediately transplanted it into a container (I live too far North to plant it in the ground), and was impressed with how well rooted it was.  This was not a fresh cutting that had just barely gotten started, it had a fairly massive rootball, which was quite excellent.  They obviously gave this thing some TLC before shipping (that or I ordered so late in the season it had rooted exceptionally well waiting for somebody to buy it).  Either way, I was quite happy with it.<br /><br />--+Overview, What is Dragonfruit?+--<br />Dragonfruit (DF), also known as Pitaya or Pitahaya, is a tropical cactus most commonly grown in Vietnam and Asia as a commercial fruit.  There are many different cultivars (that is, kinds) of DF falling into three broad catagories.  First are the whites, which is what you'll get from this purchase.  They have pink rinds with white flesh inside.  Second are the reds, which look like the whites on the outside, but have red/purple flesh.  Third are the yelllows, which have a yellow rind with white flesh.  You will also see pinks, which are a hybrid of the white and red varieties.  Different cultivars of each type will have different characteristics (different ease of growing, differing taste, etc).  Unfortunately, this listing does not specificy exactly which kind we're getting, so its next to impossible to tell until you get the fruit (and even then you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference unless you've personally tried them all).<br /><br />Flavor wise, DF tends to be mild and sweet, with the larger fruits having a stronger flavor (as opposed to some tomatoes that tend to water down the bigger they get).  The red varieties are generally sweeter than the whites, but are not as visually striking in my opinion.  The mild flavor means they they will be overpowered easily by other flavors (I wouldn't say they're bland, but don't expect a flavor explosion like an orange or strawberry would give).  Texture wise, DF are very similar to watermelon.<br /><br />Only the insides of the fruit are edible.  The pink rind is similar to that of a watermelon in that you cut through it to get to the flesh inside.  The small black seeds are edible, giving a nice crunchy contrast to the otherwise soft flesh.  Most commonly a DF is cut in half lengthwise or cut into slices like an apple.  While DF will *NOT* keep in a refridgerator for extended periods, many people prefer to chill fresh fruit before eating.  The red varieties are also good for juicing.<br /><br />--+Growing your Dragonfruit+--<br />DF may come from a cactus, but it has very different soil requirements from a normal cactus.  As a tropical, it requires rich organic soil, and slightly more frequent watering.  Don't bother with standard cactus mix, as it typically doesn't have the nutrients or the drainage requirements to really help your DF take off.  Instead, try for a standard potting soil mixed with equal parts perlite.  DF are more easily suceptible to root rot than normal, so you don't want to keep the soil wet.  It will require regular watering, but when in doubt, underwatering is better than overwatering.  Try to let the soil dry out between waterings, only watering once or twice a week.  Once your DF grows new limbs, they will be thinner and you can gently bend one to know when to water it.  If it flexes easily, its time to water.  If its stiff, leave it be.<br /><br />DF are climbers.  Like grapes or other vines, you will need to supply it something to grow up, the cactus is not capable of supporting itself once it gets bigger otherwise.  In plantations, the most common method is to wrap a pole in burlap for it to grow up, but any untreated wooden trellise should suffice.  Your pole/trellise should be at least 5 feet tall.  DF produce fruit mainly on hanging sections, not whats growing up your pole, so at the top put a crossbar or two for it to climg out over and hang down from.  This will make your DF look like a small palm tree.  You could also build a box frame like structure for it to grow in, or even grow along a fence.  How you end up doing it will depend greatly on where you live.<br /><br />When your DF gets big enough to need support, you will see it start to grow tendrils (actually air roots) that it uses to latch on to whatever is nearby.  These air roots are fully functional, sometimes becoming more important to the plant's health than the underground roots.  Occassionaly water these air roots with a mister with some balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) mixed in to help it along.  An occassional feeding with the same balanced fertilizer to the roots help promote growth as well.<br /><br />DF tolerate temperatures up to ~105簞F, down to roughly freezing.  It can stand a light frost, but any prolonged periods of below freezing temperatures will kill it.  This means it can only be planted outdoors (permanently) in regions like Florida, Southern California, south Texas, etc.  Farther north, you'll need to keep it in a container to keep it alive long enough to produce fruit.  Luckily, DF can grow in suprisingly small containers, about what you'd need for a large houseplant.  If you are in a high humidity area, your DF will do just fine in full sun.  In drier areas, partial shade is better as harsh noon-day sunlight may be too strong for it.<br /><br />--+Getting Fruit+--<br />Dragonfruit will only flower and produce fruit when the overall mass of the plant reaches roughly 10 pounds.  Depending on growing conditions and the size of your initial cutting this could take as little as 6 months, or up to two years. When it does get big enough, large white flowers will begin to bud.  These flower buds can reach 7-8"" in length before opening, and will only open at night.  To add additional insult, most varieties will only flower for a single night, so be prepared.  Luckily, they tend to flower during a full moon, so thats when you should watch the closest.  Some strains are self pollinating, some are not, and this listing does not specify which type we are getting.  Normally pollinated by bats and large moths, you may have to hand pollinate.  Make sure you take the pollen from one flower and apply it to a different one, as not all breeds are self fertile (but are fertile between flowers on the same plant).  If you're lucky enough to get fruit to set, it will take about a month for it to be ready to harvest.  Let the fruit ripen on the stalk until the scaley ""leaves"" covering it start to shrivel.  Harvesting too early means a blander fruit.<br /><br />--+Harvesting Seeds+--<br />Dragonfruit are considered heirloom plants, as they can be grown from seed. To produce the best seeds, you'll need to sacrifice one of the fruits by letting it over-rippen.  Leave it on the stalk as long as possible, then let it sit for a while longer on the shelf until its almost started going bad.  Then slice open and use a very fine strainer to extract the seeds from the fleshy pulp.  Make sure you get all of the flesh off the seeds before drying, as rotting pulp can infect the seed with various diseases.  Dry normaly (place on newspaper or paper towel and place in window sill for a week or two), and store in a small paper envelope.  Just be careful, as the seeds are exceedingly small, so watch out that you don't sneeze while preparing them. =)<br /><br />--+Making Cuttings+--<br />Dragonfruit grows exceptionally easily from cuttings.  Even easier than tomatoes.  Make a cutting at least 8-9"" long with a sterilized knife, preferrably at one of the natural branches (where one stalk ends and a new offshoot starts growing from it's end).  If that isn't an option, cuttings can still easily be made from the middle of the stalk, just let it sit out in the air (and out of the sun) for a few days for the cut end to scab over.  After that, its just a matter of sticking the base end of the cutting several inches into the soil.  DF cuttings have even been known to start rooting themselves while laying on tables with no water or soil at all, so it really is quite difficult to go wrong with one.  Please note that the cutting will not have any visible above ground growth until it has rooted itself sufficiently.  As long as your cutting is not wilting and shriveling up, its doing fine, just let it be.  And if you end up forgetting which end of your cutting is the base and which end is the top (easy to do if you end up with one stalk cut into 3, that middle piece won't have an obvious top or bottom), just remember that the spines always point up.<br /><br />Odds are that you'll be making cuttings for everyone you know, as DF can grow pretty wild looking and require pruning to keep it from taking over, and all those pruned branches are easily rootable into new plants.  If nothing else, every time you prune it back, chop it into foot long segments and put them on ebay for $5 each. ;)",1

2513,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added.

2520,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).

2526,"I understand that most of the reviews are fake and I would like to say that while I find them all very enjoyable and humorous, there is a something that a real customer of this product feels should be known.<br /><br />I purchased 10 of the rabbits for the purpose of making hare jerky (a tasty treat) when I was overcome with the desire to indulge in a bit of rabbit meat before the smoking process. Giving into my guilty urges, I took one rabbit for my own personal pre-jerky consumption and proceeded to eat the entire animal whole (I do not own a stove, only a plastic box and some firewood for smoking things, hence it was uncooked). After my little personal rabbit fiesta, I laid down to digest the food.<br /><br />This was a mistake. Within two hours, I had never felt worse. I used the trusty search engine ""Bing"" to do some armchair medical research while clutching a trashcan in the most horrendous gastric distress you can imagine (I do not have health insurance so I did not call the hospital). Quickly, I found out that a side effect to eating rabbit was ""protein poisoning,"" a situation that arises when lean meat is eaten. It is also known as ""rabbit starvation"" because rabbit meat contains almost no fat whatsoever. Apparently, consumption of large amounts of protein with little or no carbohydrates or fat is dangerous. Well you imagine how much that tickled me angry. All ready to write an angry letter of protest to the rabbit meat industry about their marketing of a dangerous foodstuff, I stumbled to my writing desk but alas, I only made it 3 feet before collapsing in pain. The next 5 hours were like a blur as I lay on the floor writhing in my own waste seeing people and things from the past and quite possibly the future. I have experimented with drugs back in the day and let me tell you, nothing came as close to disconnecting me from the universe in the worst way possible, as this. No one ever wants to experience protein poisoning, I promise you.<br /><br />At about 10 in the evening I came to and used a chair and the wall to help pull myself off of the floor. I still felt sick and I went back to my computer to see if there was a cure. Suddenly it hit me, I needed to eat other macronutrients! I remembered the tub of lard I had been saving in the fridge and stumbled across my apartment. The pain only grew worse. I remembered reading that bodybuilders eat lots of protein. I have no idea how they do it. It must be horrible for them. My vegan friend has always said that anything over 20 grams of a protein a day is overkill and I'm inclined to believe him now. He is the healthiest person I know, he is very skinny but he doesn't have visible muscle (which he says is the result of toxins and not enough body fat to properly survive). I finally reached my fridge and reached in for the I Can't Believe It's Not Butter container with my stockpiled lard. I quickly shoveled it into my mouth and wouldn't you believe it but it only made me feel worse! I passed out again, the cold air of the fridge blowing onto me.<br /><br />I awoke three days later (according to my watch) at 7 at night. The fridge had apparently preserved my body as it fought the proteins for the first night but now my electricity was off because my bill was due yesterday. It didn't matter, my body had apparently started to win the fight around 2 nights ago and now I am pretty much back to normal. However, I SINCERELY DO NOT RECOMMEND RABBIT MEAT as it can potentially kill you, as it nearly did me.<br /><br />Five stars - 1 for nearly killing me - 1 slightly chewy - 1 no head + 1 made great jerky = 3 stars",1

I do not agree with another reviewer who says that they are ""just like Cheerios"".<br /><br />Sugar content-<br />They might have only 0.5g of sugar per serving, but compared with Cheerios this is still double the sugar (those have 1 in 28g). Not that Cheerios are the measure for all baby snacks, and they are certainly not organic, but they are at least not sweet tasting.<br /><br />Packaging-<br />You will receive a box with six plastic dispensers similar to the ones you get for wipes.

2535,"I am not the main chef in our household. My husband enjoys cooking whereas my comfort zone is being the clean-up crew(washing dishes, storing leftovers away). Don't get me wrong, there are a few occasions where I will prepare a decent meal but for the most part, I'm normally in the background when it comes to the kitchen.<br /><br />With our first child, I made a feeble attempt at making my own baby food. I roasted a butternut squash in the oven, steamed a couple of vegetables then used a food processor for blending. I was excited about making my own baby food for about two weeks tops. For me, it took so much time and a lot of clean-up afterwards that I ended up purchasing ready-made baby food.<br /><br />With our second child, I decided I wanted another go at making baby food. Since I already (unsuccessfully)tried making food by steaming/baking and blending separately, I realized it made sense for me to purchase a baby food maker.  I narrowed it down to Beaba and Baby Brezza. I chose the Baby Brezza after reading the reviews for both on Amazon.<br /><br />I love the Baby Brezza. Since my daughter turned 6 months, I've prepared: green beans, sweet potatoes, carrots, chicken breast, sweet peas, pears, apples, peaches and prunes. And she is 7.5 months. Yes, I know that I've only been using it for a month and a half but the point is, I have used it every four days (the recommended time for babies to be introduced to new food) and I see myself using it until she can eat food that actually looks the way it should. It's super easy to use. You chop up the food in small 1/4 cuts, pour water into the reservoir, transfer the food into the container, decide whether you want to steam only or steam + blend, select the length of steam time and press START.<br /><br />The clean-up is pretty easy. I let the blade soak in warm, soapy water while I clean the container. I also drain the water out of the reservoir and leave the cap on the reservoir open so as to let the inside of the reservoir air dry. It takes about a day out on our kitchen counter to be completely bone dry inside the reservoir. For people concerned about mold, if you dry your reservoir completely, you have no worries. Food occasionally sticks on the blades but I use a short small bottle brush to thoroughly get in between the blades.<br /><br />My only (minor) complaint would be the blending noise. My husband and I don't mind it, my 3.5 year old son doesn't mind it, but my 7.5 month daughter gets a bit spooked. But, seriously, the instrument is blending. It's doing its job. It's a strong motor that purees fruits/vegetables/meat to a homogenous consistency. I don't blame the maker but I just want to throw that out there for people that have noise-sensitive babies.<br /><br />*FYI, the optional items really aren't necessary. The cutting board? Really, just use your hands and scoop the vegetable/fruit/meat into the collection carafe. The spatula? I'm sure you can find a baking spatula in your utensil drawer.<br /><br />**FYI again, I use little BPA-free storage cubes to store the blended foods in the freezer. For me, it's a lot easier to use than ice cube trays.",1
2536,"This is a great way of learning about different cheeses, and what there flavors are.<p>Gorgonzola is a stronger cheese, usually used for salads - very tangy with a stronger after taste, something I think everyone can really enjoy in that matter. A classic is romaine lettuce, gorgonzola and apple slices.<p>In contrast, gouda is a milder creamy cheese, great for breads. If cheddar were a starting point, I would say gouda is more creamy. It tends to break and crumble less easily, and really stick to bread surfaces better.<p>Both will make you forget about the normal supermarket colby or cheddar. I recommend this sampler highly.",1

2538,"Raw Cacao has a high Vitamin C content. This product has O% if you look at the label on the back.<br />Within the last year they covered up where it used to say Vitamin C with Vitality.

Which means that it has been cooked/processed in some way that removed that natural occurring Vitamin C.<br />I only use the highest quality cacao, from reputable sources. Less quality, Other ""raw"" cacao beans on the market are not only of cheap forastero cacao varieties, they also are contaminated with several types of dangerous bacteria (remember cacao is a tropical crop where microbe contamination is more difficult to control).<br />Remember you get what you pay for.

2540,"I have been using these bags for 3 months.  They were provided to me by the Mother's Milk Bank in San Jose.  Prior to using these bags, I had used the very popular Lansinoh bags for 3 months.<br /><br />Between the two, I much prefer the HoneySuckle bags.  Why? They are better.  How are they better, you ask?<br /><br />1. This bag is actually tamper resistant, while the Lansinoh bag is not.  The HoneySuckle bags have the entire top sealed to prevent tampering.  You cannot tamper with the bag without opening one of the three sides of the perforated top.  You remove the perforated portion to open the bag.  The Lansinoh bags have a perforated top, but not the sides of that upper area, so you could actually still open the bag without undoing the perforations.  Poor design IMO.<br /><br />2. The sides and bottom of the HoneySuckle bags are reinforced, the Lansinoh bags are not.  I pump exclusively, and even at 6 mos, my son is not eating all the milk I produce, so I freeze easily 2-4 bags of milk a day.  I can produce between 8 to as much as 14oz during a pumping session, and have been able to overfill these bags without them bursting open when they are frozen.  The reinforced sides and bottom have alot to do with that.<br /><br />3. The information to write at the top is much more useful, and is rightside up.  The Lansinoh bags have the info updside down.  That has always bothered me.  Even when you stand the bags up in the freezer, they are upside down.  It's stupid.  HoneySuckle bags have the labeling rightside up.  Plus it asks for baby's name and the date, not the volume.  I don't find the volume info helpful at all, and when my baby was in the NICU, or when donating breastmilk, the name is much more useful information.<br /><br />4. Best quality - THEY ARE BIODEGRADABLE!!  They will dissolve when they are in the landfill.  If you care about the environment at all, these are the bags for you.  The Lansinoh bags aren't biodegradable, at least from what I can tell from their packaging.  As if dirty diapers aren't a big enough contribution to the tremendous amount of trash people generate these days, breastmilk storage bags don't need to add to that.<br /><br />Price wise, these are comparable to the Lansinoh bags, except that with shipping they are a few dollars more.  But I think they are worth it from a quality and environmental standpoint.  You can also go to the New Bag Co. website and order a free sample if you aren't convinced.  IMO, these bags are superior to the Lansinoh bags and I will definitely be using them exclusively.",1
2541,"My wife's shop has a Keurig in her shop and she loved it.  She wanted to buy one and only went off visuals.  (It's black and had two cup sizes)  So to my happiness I found it on Amazon.  A taken aback was I after two weeks of backorder I finaly use at home.  In the instructions it says this is Keurig Classic B44.  Brews two cup sizes  SMALL AND SMALLER.  7.25 oz and 5.25 oz respectively.  So, it is great if you want to have tea with your imaginary friends and plastic Barbie china ware.  Not so great if you need it for your morning cup of Jose. Heck fire, it will not even fill up a normal sized travel mug / coffee cup.

2542,"Simply put, this vending machine is a piece of crap. And, dealing with the company is even worse. Just check the long list of complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau. That said here is the breakdown on how the machine works:<br /><br />Coin Mechanism - Most likely the worst Coin Mech in the Vending Business. Anyone with a piece of straw, a paper clip or even with their car keys can easily tamper it and get free candy. After a couple of months of use, it will start jamming and will work with everything BUT quarters. Unlike in the feature description, these plastic coin mechanisms will not last very long with normal use.<br /><br />Chute Doors - The chute doors are made of plastic. Very WEAK plastic. They will not last a week of normal use. This will leave an extremely unattractive machine that looks like a toothless Hockey player. Not to mention how unsanitary that is.<br /><br />Canisters - Sure the easy on, easy off design might be the best any company has come up with. However, the canisters are so weak that I have had them crack on my hands while cleaning them. Another flaw would be that these clear canisters will turn yellowish within a month if exposed to indirect sunlight of strong fluorescent lighting. Even if they aren't, they will still turn yellowish within a year.  Plus, they are very poorly manufactured. Finally these canisters would not only NOT keep the candy fresh, but also it is very easy for insects to get inside and make a total mess.<br /><br />Housing - This would be the piece attached to the metal pole and base and holds the canisters and coin mechs. It is so poorly made, that within a couple of months it will start to crack. I have had customers call me to tell me the machine fell on the floor. Imagine if it had fallen on top of a child!<br /><br />The Back ""Security"" Door - It is incredibly weak and made of plastic. Anyone with a screwdriver can steal your quarters without even breaking it.<br /><br />The Company - The Manufactures are Multivend. They might be one of the worst companies to deal with. As I said before, just read the complaints they have at the Better Business Bureau.<br /><br />If you are looking for a novelty TOY, this machine would be perfect if they didn't want to charge you over $100.00 for each (A new Unit can set you back almost $400.00). I would pay no more than $40.00 for a unit. But, if you are looking for an investment, then look elsewhere. I can recommend the Beaver Machines. Those are the best in the market. I've made more money with around 40 Beaver Units than the over 300 units of Vendstar 3000 Machines I purchased will ever produce.",1

2547,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",0
2548,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",0
2549,"I was excited to find a natural sugar substitute when I came across Xylitol.  When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn't look too good. She told me she didn't feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn't feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn't had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.<br />In between bathroom trips, I Googled: ""Xylitol reactions"" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.  So when you consider that the three of us have different genetics, and yet we all had a problem with this stuff, I'd say that probably more than 20% of people that try this, will have a reaction.<br />BUYER BEWARE!  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4"">Xlear - Xylosweet 5lb, 5 lb, 1 bag</a>",0

2557,"Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />This one, the Sharp Cheddar flavor, is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, but when you try it side-by-side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />The Four Cheese meal (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZ4Q"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference.",1

I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.",1
2565,"I bought this Keurig after I had coffee at my sister's house. The coffee maker I was using at home was your standard traditional one but I found that I kept wasting coffee and then the grounds would go stale. It wasn't a right fit maker for me. So, I bought this Keurig. The machine seems to take a longer time than my sister's (whose was more expensive) but it's fine. The reservoir on the left is handy because it means you don't have to fill up water every time you make a cup. I find that I need two Keurig cups for a full large mug full of coffee but I knew that going in. All in all, if you drink the occasional cup, or want a variety of flavors, I would recommend this one to you.",1
2566,"I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.",1
2567,"I want to comment on a previous review which asserts that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDBPZC"">Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Buckwheat Groats Raw, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> are misadvertised and are not a raw product.  I beg to differ please.<br /><br />These wonderful groats are in fact RAW.  I buy them often from Amazon and being a raw foodie, sprout them before consuming.  I've never had a problem with these groats not sprouting and they would NOT sprout had they been steamed as the disgruntled reviewer claims.  They seem to green up after soaking and will sprout quickly  ~ as a matter of fact, just yesterday I made some buckwheat brownies and cookies for Christmas treats and the groats sprouted in 12 hours!  (Of course I live in Florida and the warm weather may be a factor). By the way, my treats turned out incredibly delicious and I give credit to the quality of the Bob's buckwheat.<br /><br />I love this product, especially that it is organic, and trust completely that if Bob's Red Mill says they are organic and raw, well then they are.<br /><br />I also want to add that when purchased at Amazon, and in particular at Subscribe and Save, they are a real value.  They are so much cheaper here than at my local health food store.",1
2568,"Annie Chun's Classic Pad Thai Meal Kit provides the basic ingredients (rice noodles and sauce) for stir-fried pad thai. You need to add vegetable oil, tofu, chicken or shrimp, eggs, bean sprouts,  green onions, and (not essential) lime, peanuts, and fresh cilantro from your own kitchen. Choose tofu for a vegetarian pad thai or combine with shrimp or chicken as you like. Of course, it would be less expensive to make pad thai from scratch. But the pre-packaged sauce is convenient, and this ranks high among the pad thais that I've tasted. The box says that preparation takes 10 minutes, but 20 minutes is more realistic. No MSG or preservatives. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />There are 2 sets of instructions on the box, which is confusing. On the side panel, there are instructions for boiling the noodles. Those are for people who want to eat the noodles with sauce only. The instructions for stir-fried pad thai ""with all the trimmings"" are on the back of the box. This recipe instructs you to soak the rice noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. It helps if the water is boiling hot, and you will probably need to soak them longer to get the noodles soft enough. The noodles will soften a little after they are added to the other ingredients, but not much. Apart from the problem of undercooked noodles, the recipe on the box works well and tastes great.<br /><br />Ingredients: Noodles: rice flour, water. Sauce: brown sugar, water, tamarind, soy sauce (water, wheat, soybeans, salt), onion and shallot puree, fish sauce (anchovy, salt, water), canola oil, tomato paste, rice vinegar, garlic, corn starch, lime juice concentrate, spices, onion powder.

2569,"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one.",1
2570,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",0

I know how sweet southern ice tea should taste. Well this Chick is no longer in Dixie. I've been searching for the perfect sweet tea for the past 5 yrs. Anyone who has made southern sweet tea the old school way, knows that it takes a lot of time to get the consistency just right. Once that's done the tea goes fast, thus the cycle continues. This tea is awesome!! Keurig makes it easy! Just keep in mind the K-cup is not REALLY sweet. Southerners call the tea itself ""SWEET"" not because of the suger but because of a particular taste. (This is a hard point to get across if you are not accustomed to drinking many different sweet teas down south) I use a glass pitcher, fill a fourth of the pitcher with sugar, then fill the entire pitcher with hot boiling water. Stir with a long spoon...(careful it will be HOT) until the water is completely clear. It's what we call a SIMPLE SYRUP down south. Before you brew your K-Cup, drop a splash of simple syurp in your glass or over your ice. The Sweet Perfect Ice Tea will then truely be PERFECT! FYI: If you live up north like I do and crave ice tea all year round...You'd better stock up on your K-cups by end of summer. The company considers the GREEN MOUNTAIN SOUTHERN SWEET PERFECT ICE TEA a seasonal item, (the NERVE!!) making them almost impossible to get in the winter and tripple the cost!!!! Enjoy!!!",1
2578,"I have a Keurig coffee maker, which brews a fresh cup of gourmet coffee, tea, or cocoa in less than a minute. If you are not familiar with this machine, it is wonderfully convenient, especially for me, as I only make 1 or two hot beverages at home per day. But I am not reviewing the Keurig coffee maker. I am here to write a glowing review for ""Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for Keurig Brewers.""<br /><br />In the winter hot cocoa is my favorite coffee alternative, and Caf&eacute; Escapes Cafe Mocha is my favorite brand/blend. I have tried 2-3 other brands but nothing compares to the full flavor of this product.<br /><br />I do not taste any artificial sweeteners, and I am sensitive to sugary substitute tastes. I use the 6 oz setting, and the rich, chocolate flavor with the extra tang of coffee is delicious. I used to prefer Starbucks mocha, but now when I compare the two, Starbucks comes across as too heavy, almost syrupy in comparison.<br /><br />This product contains milk, soy and tree nuts (highly refined coconut oil). It is trans fat and gluten free. The caffeine content is estimated at less than 10 mg per serving and the cocoa is sweetened.<br /><br />I highly recommend Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha K-Cups for cocoa and mocha lovers.<br />Jana Perskie",1

So not. These taste awful. They tasted like fish and not in a good way. I think this must be what the bottom of a river tastes like.

(Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.

The best temperature is around 80C (176F- NOT boiling hot). After pouring the hot water, steep about 30-45 sec, then take the bag out.

This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.<br /><br />They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.<br /><br />My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again.",1

I saw some earlier reviews complaining about taste and I honestly have no problem slowly sipping on this shake as I drive to work in the morning. I have tasted some horrid protein shakes in the past and this one is delicious!<br /><br />Overall Feeling:<br /><br />I feel fantastic after having Amazing Meal in the morning. Completely clear minded and energized for the day. Even without the accompaniment of a multivitamin, this meal powder stands alone in providing a days worth of energy and clear minded thinking.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I found that I needed to get used to the added probiotic that is apart of the meal. I found myself for the first four or five days, starving only 2 hours after drinking one of these shakes. It was like I couldn't get enough food, I had to eat every two to three hours to stop the hunger. I am unsure whether it has to do with the combo of probiotic or the digestive enzyme that is added. Like I said though, after 5 days that feeling of starving all the time went away. It now fulfills me completely.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the best meal shake I have come across thus far in my search for the perfect morning/ after workout shake.

2596,"I purchased Honeyville Food Products' Powdered Egg Whites for many years directly from Honeyville Farms. During that time, the ingredient labels on the cans have always stated: ""Ingredients: Powdered Egg Whites"" and nothing else. I will say that I love this product. Even cooked in butter as scrambled eggs with just a little salt, it tastes like whole fresh eggs to me.  Definitely no offensive odor or taste.<br /><br />Eariler this week I was going to purchase another can when I happened to look at the ingredients listed on their Web site -- ""Ingredients: Egg Whites, less than 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate (added as a whipping aid)"". This came as a great surprise to me, I thought they had started using SLS as an additive. I decided to do some research and couldn't find anything about SLS except that it is used in soaps, shampoos and toothpastes. Nowhere was there a mention of it being in food. I went so far as to question the FDA. Yesterday I wrote the following e-mail to the Director of E-Commerce of Honeyville Food Products, Inc. and received a reply today:<br /><br />""I have purchased your powdered egg whites for a number of years and have been extremely happy with them. I also purchase some of your other products that do not contain additives or preservatives...<br /><br />I am very unhappy to see that Sodium Lauryl Sulfate has been added (to your powdered egg whites). Although this additive is approved by the FDA, I see little use for it to be in an egg product. I realize SLS has been used for many years in soaps, shampoos and other products that are expected, by the general public, to foam. But, these are products that are used externally and then rinsed off. Even then, SLS is an irritant to some people. I also realize that the FDA requires SLS to be used in lesser amounts where foods are concerned, but when using a product daily as I do the powdered egg whites (for smoothies) I worry about the build-up over time.<br /><br />The only possibility I can see why this additive is being used is because of meringue. I made meringues numerous times with your egg whites and they have always come out high and beautiful -- there was never a need for SLS"".<br /><br />Following is the reply I received today:<br /><br />""I'm sorry to hear that we've lost you as an Egg White customer.  Our Egg Whites have always had the small amount of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate as a whipping aid.  When Egg Whites are pasteurized they lose the whipping characteristics that fresh egg whites have.  I appreciate the feedback and will weigh it against that of the customers that need the Egg Whites to whip up.

I don't want to vilify SLS, I'm just looking for honesty in marketing so I can make a choice.<br /><br />I gave this review only one star because I was not given that choice.",1
2597,"For a number of years, I have purchased Pellegrino by the case at, Costco.  I have three problems with Pellegrino:<br /><br />(1) I don't know how much a bottle used to hold, but to me it seems that the bottles over the years have decreased in size, it seems like the company slimmed down the bottle to hold less water.  I am certain the price didn't decrease.<br /><br />(2) Just recently, I purchased a case and found the seal on the bottles so insufficient that I have had to pour out all the contents of a newly opened bottle, no fizz. Just this weekend I had to pour out the water in two brand new bottles.<br /><br />(3) If I do have a newly opened bottle that is fizzy, I've also noticed that the bottle tops do not hold the fizz for long after the bottle has been opened, say only a few days in the fridge.  I usually replace the Pellegrino top by recycling a lid from a plastic Coke bottle.<br /><br />I have heard that the store, ShopRite has a nice store-named product that is imported from Italy and tastes like Pellegrino. I'm switching.<br /><br />(Let's hope ShopRite keeps the cost reasonable, keeps bottle size the same, and has a better lid.)",0

It is tough for us to gag down American chocolate anymore.  They grind the cocoa beans finer and use less fat and less sugar, so it is much better for you. I am diabetic and it does not send my sugars up.<br /><br />Belgians have very strong opinions when it comes to which chocolate is ""best"".

2599,"This review is for the grapefruit flavor, but I've tried clementine and pomegranate, too.<br /><br />I'm continually surprised at what passes for ""healthy"".  I received this product to review but was already familiar with Izze sodas, as they're available at most Starbucks and now at grocery stores, as well.<br /><br />These are 8.4 oz cans and each can is 90 calories.  Since nutritional data isn't included in the item description, I'll include them here.<br />Each 8.4 oz serving has 10 mg sodium, 20 gm carbohydrates, and 20 grams of sugar.<br /><br />So, for those who believe this is a ""healthy"" alternative to sodas, I would disagree.  An 8-oz serving of Caffeine-free Coca Cola Classic has 97 calories, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 33 gm sodium, 24 grams of sugar.<br /><br />So, really, having an Izze isn't such a healthy alternative to having a coke.  You aren't reducing your sugar intake with an Izze nor will you reduce your carb intake.  Yes, it's juice and ""natural"" but your body responds to sugar and carbs quite the same whether the sugar comes from juice or another source.<br /><br />The sugars that come from juice is fructose-- and your body responds to fructose the same way it responds to table sugar.  They both cause your insulin levels to increase.  Each 8 oz glass of juice has about 8 full teaspoons of sugar.  So, if this 8.4 oz can of Izze soda is made up of 70% juice, you are still consuming 5.8 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Whole fruit is much healthier than juice since the fiber has not been stripped away.  Fiber moderates the release of the sugar in your bloodstream and moderates the insulin release.<br /><br />Sorry for the nutrition lesson.<br /><br />Izze sodas TASTE good-- and even this Grapefruit (and I don't care for grapefruit) tastes good.  As long as one understands they aren't having something ""healthy"" when they have this sparkling juice, great-- if it's just taste you are looking for, give this a try.  Sometimes, though, a pretty label and a spot on a shelf in the Organic Food store causes people to believe that what they are consuming is healthy when, in fact, it's just not.<br /><br />I received a case of 24 cans.  My family enjoys Izze sparkling juices because they taste good and, because we have them, I don't mind them drinking them.  Even though I will occasionally purchase Izze juices for my children when we're out and hit Starbucks, I never buy sugary drinks at the store.  I consider these sparkling juices to be empty calories. When this supply is through, we won't buy them again to keep at home.<br /><br />4 stars for taste.",1

Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.

2605,"I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products.

2606,"I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs."" Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.",1

2608,I've used it three times so far and it was great all three times and it makes outstanding leftovers (I used 3 packets at once last time!).  I added the spice packet two times but I wasn't all that thrilled with bitting into bits and pieces of the various parts while I ate.  So the last time I made it I first started with the butter and added the spice packet (simmer according to instructions).  Next I added 1.5 cups of water then I let this simmer.<br /><br />Next I prepared the veggies.  The first time I didn't use the lemon curd as instructed.  The second time I did.  The third time I used plain yogurt (6oz per packet).  The lemon was my least favorite and the yogurt was my most favorite.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes of simmering the spice packet (when the veggie prep was done) I strained the water/spice mix into the veggies.  Then I followed the recipe to the end.,1
2609,"This spaghetti makes for some good food, but it certainly doesn't make the best shoes. I was advised to buy this specific spaghetti (De Cecco) along with a chocolate shoe mold (which doubles as a real shoe mold) in order to make my own shoes. After successfully crafting the shoes (after dehydrating them via baking), I tried them out. Note: the chocolate shoe mold doesn't offer different sizes, so the shoes were a bit smug. I won't let that impact my current review, however; I am focused on the spaghetti.<br />Unfortunately, I have to label the shoes as a failure for several reasons:<br /><br />Durability: the packaging doesn't warn you, but as soon as you bake the previously boiled noodles, they tend to crack without too much strain. I am 14 pounds, and I cracked my right shoes after 2 steps. The left held out for 14.5 steps (a large gust of wind was the source of demise). Needless to say, I had to make 7 pairs of shoes to make it to the bathroom.<br /><br />Shock absorber: after baking the noodles, they refused to give as they tried to act as a medium between the ground and my feet. I suffer from lower-back problems, and the incessant cracking of the noodles absorbed shock temporarily, but failed to work for too long (steps 3-14.5 for the left foot)<br /><br />Style options: Sadly, De Cocco doesn't offer spaghetti in a variety of colors, such as turquoise and violet. I like to branch out from the norm, and I find myself with similar shoes to my peers as a result of the manufacturer's failure to diversify.<br /><br />These are three of the primary reasons that I have to label the spaghetti as ""minimally versatile.""",0

If one likes to have the main flavor of a nut bar as peanuts, you will enjoy this.<br />The quality of KIND products I appreciate, as well as the low GI, the natural properties, and having a healthier choice. But honesty in advertising and product would be appreciated.<br /><br />I was disappointed with the deception, and the unexpectedly strong flavor of peanuts, as I purchased it for the nuts I like best, which were supposed to be the main source of nut protein.<br />Let's get honest KIND!",1
2612,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",1
2613,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent.

That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary.

Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary.

2619,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly.",1

2621,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",1

And I have an old jar that I never finished (really big one), and nearly two years later, after sitting right by the stove, it still smells fresh, like Cuban coconut candy my mom used to make. Yes, solid and fresh and white and fragrant TWO YEARS LATER. This is a very stable product.<br /><br />Recommended.",1
2625,"This has been around in Europe for ages - many of my friends have it in London and I can see the apeal of this little steamer/grinder combo gadget however the price in the US is unbelievable!! It makes no sense to buy this when a regular ""adult"" steamer (such as the Black & Decker I reviewed) with a basket 4x the size is $30! I make my own baby food and love having a large basket to cook 4 sweet potatoes at once or a whole bag of baby carrots and freezing the extra portions in ice cube trays. With the Babycook, one would have to steam & puree almost every day -- who has the time? Secondly, with many baby foods, you have to remove the skins after steaming anyway, so it completely defeats the purpose of steaming & pureeing in the same basket. Lastly, when doing some reasearch into this product, I found that it may leech BPA chemicals so please look into this if it is important to you.<br /><br />All in all, I think the Babycook looks adorable and has a cute little name and packaging but if you are a busy, tired mom, do yourself a big favor and get a regular, adult-sized steamer (like the B&D) that can make a month of purreed baby food at a time to freeze and re-heat when needed. The baby will outgrow this machine in a few months and then you are stuck with a $150 useless appliance. With a regular steamer, you can make dinner for your family simply and easily for years",1
2626,"These pretzels are evil. When my snacking comes to an end, I see flashes of myself laying on the unkempt wooden floor of an abandoned house. Scant beams of light burn between the cracks in the boards on the lone window frame, illuminating my tattered and orange-stained clothes. The sound of my body writhing over a pool of empty yellow aluminum bags, a half foot high up the empty broken walls, is quieted only by the echo of my cries of longing and despair.",1
2627,"I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system.",1
2628,"This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a ""half diet"" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.",1

2633,"I've had Kashi cereals in the past and this was certainly the crunchiest of them all. Kashi managed to perfectly sweeten this cereal just the way I like and I found this cereal to be extremely filling. When I eat other brands as a meal I normally feel like I need to eat two bowls, but with Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! I was very satisfied with less than a bowlful. I find this cereal is best when I let it sit in the bowl of milk for about 5 minutes before eating it to soften the crunchiness a bit.

2634,"My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)",1
2635,I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.,1
2636,"Assorted Vegans! For only $35? What a deal! I was quite looking forward to receiving my Assorted Box of Vegans, but when it arrived, I was woefully disappointed to find a box full of cookies. I was really hoping for a diverse group of Vegans with whom I could converse, and learn more about the Vegan lifestyle. You see, I tend to view Vegans pretty negatively--I can't stand their jeremiads about unethical treatment of animals, long-winded explanations about why honey is the product of animal abuse, and why pleather shoes are a legitimate fashion choice. I really wanted to get my assorted Vegans settled around a crackling fire so we could explore their philosophy and mine, and see if we couldn't reach some truce with each other. Sadly, this was not meant to be, and I was left with a poor substitute for authentic, chock-full-o-butter and eggs cookies.",1
2637,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest.",1

2641,"This coconut water is much better than the Brazilian sourced coconut waters such as Zico.  The Thai sourced coconut water is sweeter and and the flavor is more interesting, but there is no added sugar like you find in a lot of coconut ""juices"".  I really enjoy the pulp bits, gives you a little coconut to chew on, just like a fresh coconut would.  I could see how some people wouldn't like this though, so if unsure you may want to get the pulp-free water.  The prices are great on Amazon if you get a subscription, as the 9.5 ounce bottles are $2 pretty much everywhere in NYC, so for the same price you get a lot more in these cans.  Only down side is that they are so good that you go through them really fast, we can't keep them around more than 3 days before they are all gone!
