2649,"I've been eating domestic raw honey for a while now to soothe my stomach, but turned to the ""stronger"" (and obviously more expensive) manuka honey after hearing about its healing capabilities.<br /><br />When I received the Wedderspoon organic manuka honey, I opened it up, and smelled its interesting aroma. It almost has a hint of antiseptic smell to it, along with the sweet honey scent. And it tastes like it smells, but you do get used to it, and it is absolutely delicious. It is thinner and runnier than ""Really Raw"" brand american honey, so I find myself eating it faster, which is fine except I am about to run out shortly after buying it. But for me, an admittedly starving artist who is notoriously thrifty, it is still definitely worth the money.<br /><br />So what has it done for me?<br />It calms my heartburn, helps my digestion, reduces nausea associated with IBS, and I've used it on a skin infection with great success. All while being completely natural and delicious.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this honey - if you've read about the benefits of manuka honey you will be pleased to find that it does everything they says it does [and more].<br /><br />I will be ordering one more jar from Amazon, before moving to New Zealand at the end of the summer, where I will be quite excited to buy it locally!"
2650,"I purchased this product expecting a high quality lobster meat, most likely a whole lobster tail crammed into a tuna can - the best way I like it! I usually open the can and dump it in a saucepan full of butter and herbs and boil the meat for about 3 hours. While this lobster meat looked all oily and gross, like a Philip Seymour Hoffman sex scene, it was quite edible. I was getting ready to serve it on a bed of cornflakes (saw that on the Bigfoot Contessa) and to my amazement, found the product was full of hair, teeth and lobster bones! I knew I couldn't serve this to my guests, who were coming over for a very special dinner party to celebrate Casimir Pulaski Day. Instead of the lobster, I thawed some spinach, wonderbread and breakfast sausage meat, processed it in the food processor with a bit of egg and mayonnaise for binder, and stuffed the delectable mixture into halves of cling-peaches. I chilled them and served with a dash of cayenne pepper and a dusting of powdered sugar. While Ina-Garten-da-vida may not have approved, my friends did not complain, and I had TONS of leftovers!"
2651,"Too grainy and not a distinct coconut flavor. I was expecting a coconut milk consistency for frozen deserts, coffee and soups. Too much oil in this product to use in coffee and too grainy for soups and deserts.  It may be good for baking, but I haven't tried that as yet. I do like the fact that it is condensed and you add water to it, good packaging."
2652,"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
2653,"My parents were never very religious, but they still celebrated Easter Sunday.  By celebrated I mean they gave us each a basket of candy in the morning and then we'd go out to eat for dinner.  Jesus, God, and the crucifixion were never discussed.<br /><br />They used to give us a variety of different chocolate Easter related products, like Cadbury Eggs, chocolate bunnies, and Peeps.  On the eve before Easter 1990 my parents gave me a box of 48 full sized Snickers bars.  It was purchased at Price Club (which became Costco) and was the same box supplied to convenience stores.<br /><br />After dinner I opened my box and had a bar each before I began playing what would become a marathon videogame session of Rambo for the Sega Master System.  My father sat down and watched me play.<br /><br />""Did you open your Easter box?""<br /><br />""Yeah, but I only had one.""<br /><br />""Just one?""<br /><br />""It's not like I could eat them all tonight.""<br /><br />He considered me for a minute and then said, ""You know what, I bet you could eat them all tonight.""<br /><br />After hemming and hawing with him for a couple of minutes he finally began to taunt us.  ""What are you, a wimp?  Go ahead and start eating, do it!""<br /><br />My manhood was then challenged and he was getting angry.  I knew better than to poke the bear.<br /><br />The first 10 bars went down pretty well.  Since I knew I was in for the long haul I began pounding the candy bars with Diet Pepsi (hey, why waste calories?)  The combination of the massive amounts of sugar and caffeine made me loopy.  I paused my game and laid down for a bit.  My father yelled at me to keep going.<br /><br />The next couple of bars weren't so easy.  This challenge would be won by pacing.  I decide to eat no more than 5 or 6 Snickers bars an hour.  I must have polished off an entire case of the soda as well.  At midnight my father went to bed, but before he left he told me that I had better finish that box.  ""Make the family proud!""<br /><br />I ate the last bar around 5:00 am.  My brother celebrated the victory with me and then we started waiting for my parents to get up.<br />The wait was broken almost two hours later.  Ever since the first couple of bars I had felt gross, but now I felt deathly ill.  At around 7:00 my stomach lurched and the urge to purge hit me like a truck.  I ran to the bathroom and lost all control.  I shot nougat, chocolate and peanuts everywhere.  I filled the sink and the toilet.  I was so loud that I woke up my parents.<br /><br />For a second I had imagined a triumphant victory where my father exclaimed that he was proud of me.  That image evaporated when he yelled, ""You ate all of those things?  What are you an idiot?""<br /><br />Over the next couple of hours I evacuated half digested (and fully digested) Snickers bars from both ends.  If you melt a Snickers bar in the microwave you can get the same image as I saw...once again, from both ends.  After the first bout of vomiting my nose was bleeding from the small jagged peanuts that had flown out of it at 30 mph.  Luckily the nougat kept most of the blood from spraying all over the place.  It felt like I had wet cotton balls shoved up my nose and a serious case of stomach flu.  It seemed like I had an endless supply of material to spew forth, and after 48 bars I guess I did.  No one seemed to care that I was heaving all day - even my brother lost interest after an hour or two.<br /><br />By late afternoon everyone else was ready for dinner.  We all piled into the car and drove to a Chinese restaurant.  We had to pull over twice for me to chuck, once I didn't open the door fast enough.  I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />I remember placing the order for egg drop soup.  The next hour was spent in the bathroom.  By the time we got home though, I did manage to eat and keep down the soup.  It didn't taste very good and it was cold, but it stayed where it was supposed to.<br /><br />It was at least five years before I ate any chocolate at all - the smell made me gag, and almost 13 years before I risked eating a Snickers bar again.  I remember eating the thing and then waiting, but luckily nothing happened.  I no longer like the taste of Pepsi - that night converted me to Coke.<br /><br />So, yeah.  Buy the box.  Just don't eat them all in one sitting."
2654,"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
2655,"I ordered these noodles after reading about them on Hungry Girl.  Yes, they smell when you open them.  Just pour them into a strainer & rinse under warm water.  Then boil them for 2-5 minutes.  After that, I didn't think they smelled bad at all.  They do have a different texture, but I was able to chew them.<br /><br />If you are on a diet & tend to blow it over pasta, give these a try.  You can have a whole bag for minimal calories.  I added tomato sauce & parm. cheese.  While it's not an exact replacement for spaghetti, it does the trick if I want a big bowl of pasta."
2656,"In case you haven't noticed, the manufacturer has recently changed the concents of the cans of the fish and shrimp feast.  Much more fish scraps and water, and correspondingly less fish meat, which I'm sure increases their profit margin, but it's not as good for the cats.  Our cats used to really like it, too, but not any more."
2657,"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA"">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend."
2658,"Eden Organic's tomato canned products CONTAIN BPA.  Their canned beans are BPA free that is why it is confusing.  I called the company to verify. Unfortunately, I bought a whole case of them before I found out they contain BPA.<br /><br />I asked Eden Organics if they had any plans to provide their tomato products in BPA free packaging such as jars but they said no, they are not equipped for it.<br /><br />I think I will call again and let them know I am interested in BPA free tomato products, maybe if they get enough feedback from customers, they will make BPA free tomato products.  Their number if you are interested is 1-888-424-EDEN (3336) or you can email them at info@edenfoods.com. Their website is [...]<br /><br />I have found some tomato products that are not in cans.  I found most of them at the health food store, but have seen some at our regular grocery store now so hopefully the demand for such products is being heard.  I have not used these products yet, but will be doing so this weekend. I wish I had kept track of the prices. I believe they are all BPA free but not sure if maybe the jar lids have some BPA, nonetheless exposure would be considerably less than a whole can lining.<br /><br />Bionaturae - Organic tomato paste (in jars)<br />Bionaturae - Organic strained tomatoes (in jars)<br />Cirio - Passata Rustica, crushed tomatoes (in jars)<br />Lucini - Organics Tuscan Harvest plum tomatoes, whole, peeled (in jars)<br />Pomi - chopped tomatoes (tetra pak - like a milk carton)<br /><br />From what I have been told, the FDA has not approved any BPA free can liners for tomatoes--not sure if this is true.  Tomatoes are very acidic so they leach the aluminum from the cans that is why they are lined by something impervious to the acid hence the lining that contains BPA.  Frankly, I think I would prefer the aluminum over BPA.  I do know that if they went back to the linings they used before BPA was used, it would shorten the shelf life of the product because the lining they used to use disintegrates over time due to the acidity of the tomatoes and the tomatoes would taste like aluminum."
2659,I am very disappointed with this SELLER!<br />What a waste of money!<br /><br />They again used a very flimsy box which was virtually opened during shipping. 8 of individual packages out of 20 were already open and had no residual air to cushion them while shipping. This also had weird old oil smell and expiration date was again Sep 2008.  I ate a couple of them which looked intact. Usually Nomshim snacks have 1 yr expiration date and the seller sent the old product which were about to expire. I wouldn't recommend you to purchase from this seller.
2660,"""Tuscan Whole Milk"" can be re-arranged to say ""I'll know mustache"".  Coincidence?  I think not."
2661,"Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!"
2662,Absolutely one of the blandest things i have ever tasted.  I wouldnt be surprised if the box had more flavor.
2663,"In order to be truly a ""natural"" product, Pirate's Booty should be created GMO-free. There is considerable doubt about the safety of Monsanto's GMO corn [...] and demand a GMO-free product!"
2664,"Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a ""C"").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food"
2665,"I have worked with imported cheeses for most of my life, and it's great to see Spanish cheeses get their due. Spain is right up there with France as far as variety, great flavors, and quality goes. What they are behind on is marketing. Spain is where France was 30-40 years ago. Now there is a huge interest in Spanish cuisines -wines, tapas, and fine cheeses.The cuisine is large and complex enough that chefs will be playing around with it for a good long time. This selection is an outstanding introduction to Spanish cheeses.  Different milks-Manchego and Idiazabal are sheep, mahon is cow, and Murcia vino is often nicknamed ""The Drunken Goat"" due to it's milk and that it is marinated in a local Murcian wine. There are different textures and also different geographical areas represented as well. If you have any interest in Spanish cuisine, this is an outstanding launch pad to get you started. Spanish cuisine is not a new whimsey that U.S. chefs are going to beat into the ground.(Remember truffle oil on EVERYTHING?) You'll see Spanish products, techniques, and innovations for a long time. These versatile and yummy cheeses will get you started to watch the upcoming parade of spanish foods."
2666,"After attempting to use Wilton food writers on candy melts (successfully, but difficult and very spotty), these AmeriColor food writers are a dream! They're so smooth, and make perfect, crisp lines. Plus, the tips are very flexible, so lines can be thin or thick, depending on the amount of pressure applied. I use them for candy chocolate-covered cake pops, and plan on keeping a supply of these markers on hand at all times!"
2667,"The weight of this product was not specified by the seller and the picture is too blurry to see the details. The product description says 10+ oz, but it's only shipping weight.

2671,"My wife and I thought we were doing our baby a favor by going organic.  We switched from Similac to this formula and it's hard to say if the issues we had were because of this formula....after a 10 day half and half schedule we noticed less pooping and violent screaming after eating.  Since this is our first two kids (twins) we can't say if it's the formula but something didn't seem right.  Then a friend emailed about the controversy of the synthetic additives in this formula...do your own research, but we have since switched to Baby's Only (too early to tell if it's cured the issues) and we feel better we have steered clear of the fact we might be doing more harm than good.

With the exception of some prescription formulas, available with approval from pediatricians, only one over-the-counter formula is available without synthetic DHA/ARA, Baby,s Only, an organic product manufactured by Nature,s One in Columbus, Ohio.<br /><br />After today,s official announcement by the USDA, all other organic formula manufacturers will need to remove Martek,s oils from their products, Cornucopia,s Vallaeys stated.<br /><br />In the meantime, The Cornucopia Institute also has filed petitions with the FDA requesting that their Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation for the Martek oils be revoked.<br /><br />When Martek,s additives were originally granted GRAS status, it was with extreme reservations on the part of the FDA review panel because of adverse reactions to these oils said Valleys. When we reviewed FOIA documents, we were astonished to find that none of the infant formula manufacturers had complied with the FDA,s request to monitor adverse reactions and perform post-market surveillance of these materials.<br /><br />The manufacturing process for Martek,s oils likely includes genetically engineered organisms and neurotoxic synthetic solvents, which are both explicitly banned in organic production. According documents submitted by Martek to the FDA, the process to make their oils includes growing algae and fungus in a medium that is made primarily of dextrose derived from corn, yeast extract or a hydrolyzed vegetable protein, which is usually derived from soybeans. Given that the vast majority of corn and soybean products in the food supply are produced through genetic engineering, the likelihood that Martek,s DHA and ARA oils are grown in a medium of genetically engineered organisms is almost certain. The use of genetic engineering is, of course, strictly prohibited in organics.<br /><br />UPDATE - Ok we are 10 days in and our twins are much much happier.  We did 3 days of half and half and decided to fully switch to Baby's Only.  The intense screaming after eating has stopped and now both our girls are more regular. They go once every one to two days vs every 5 to 6.  Much less fussy and happier overall.  Was it the formula change or just a stage they went through?  Maybe a little bit of both, but there is no doubt I'd never use Earth's Best again....nothing worse than seeing both your daughters screaming after eating especially when you thought you were buying something good for them....they need to remove that crap from this product."
2672,I bought this in an attempt to replace high sugar organic juices with something naturally sweetened with Stevia.  My daughter and I both had one and were severely ill with diarrhea for two days.  She is 11 and was doubled over in pain.  I do not recommend this product for anyone.  I've talked to two other mothers who've tried this product and had similar issues.  Sobe should be ashamed promoting this product with a KNOWN side affect.
2673,"After I had a pizza with truffles and porcini mushrooms in a small town in Tuscany, I was a committed truffle fan.<br /><br />And the deal was already sealed when I had potato chips with truffle oil.<br /><br />It was with at least those two things in mind that I started looking for truffle oil. My first attempt was La Tourangelle (see my review on Amazon).  You really have to work to find the truffle essence in the Tourangelle version.<br /><br />But, JR's La Truffiere is the real deal.  Pungent, garlicky, and very powerful.  I've only tried two different truffle oils, but I'll risk giving this one a five star rating since I can't imagine a better version."

2675,"I'm making myself tell what I would prefer to keep secret:  Truly this is the best-quality,genuine article,cold-pressed (in small quantities)olive oil, made right here in the U.S.A. (California).  People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard.  Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago:  simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate!  This is not ""snooty gourmets"" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT.<br /><br />By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear:  true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product.<br /><br />Even Olive Oil can get complicated:  the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani.<br /><br />I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!<br /><br />YES IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THEIR REVIEWS."

With the current fear of rice shortage, we suggest you get yourself a bag of this rice now.<br /><br />Royal Basmati Rice brings eating rice to a new level.  I first learned about it a few years ago in New Orleans at a combination Middle Eastern restaurant/grocery.  The owner there had not heard someone from Mississipi talk before, and he kept following me around the store because he was fascinated with my accent.  He asked me if I was from Scotland.  He sold me my first bag of Royal Basmati. ""This is what we use to feed our customers,"" he said.  I had no idea that rice could taste that good.<br /><br />Here is the way the Royal people recommend you cook it:<br />Cooking Instructions for Stovetop<br /><br />1 cup of uncooked Royal Basmati Rice yields 3 cups cooked Rice.<br /><br />Measure: 1 cup of rice, 1 翻 cups of water, 1 tablespoon of oil, butter or margarine, a pinch of salt.<br /><br />1.

We simply keep it on the shelf without a problem.<br /><br />Cooked rice can be kept in the refrigerator for six days or frozen up to six months. To reheat just add 2 tablespoons of liquid, cover and heat for about 5 minutes on top of the stove or 1 minute on HIGH in the microwave.

2677,"Citric acid is one of those incredibly useful items to have on hand. I use it mainly for cleaning tasks such as:<br /><br />> cleaning coffee machines - works much better than vinegar at removing hard water deposits.<br /><br />> cleaning hot water pots - as above. Much easier and less smell than using vinegar.<br /><br />> cleaning dishwashers - add a couple of tablespoons and run the dishwasher through a cycle when it is empty. Makes the interior sparkle like new.<br /><br />> boosting dishwasher detergent performance - add a small amount (about a teaspoon or less) to dishwasher detergent. Really boosts the cleaning power and eliminates hazy dishes. Be careful not to use too much, however, since it can pit delicate glass or metal.<br /><br />> cleaning steam cleaners, steam mops and irons - gets all the crud out.<br /><br />Basically, this is the best cleaner for anything that is affected by hard water deposits. You can buy commercial products such as Cleancaf or other similar cleaners, but the main active ingredient is citric acid. You can get it bulk at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />The only downside is that this comes packaged in a thin plastic sack. The first thing you'll want to do is transfer it to a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Makes it much easier to store and use. Regardless of the container, citric acid clumps up easily when there's humidity in the air, but that does not affect its performance. Just bust up the clump and you're good to go. The shelf life is indefinite when you use it as a cleaning product.<br /><br />Highly recommend."

2679,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price."

Thought this would be the way to go-not only save money on lunches, but to keep it a long time without spoilage. I couldn't wait to get my peanut butter-had the jelly and bread just a-waitin', but low and behold, when I tried to spread it on the bread-yuck-wouldn't even adhere to the knife out of the jar! Next, I tried shaking it from the jar onto the bread, but when I picked the bread up, it fell clean off. Someone suggested I put the jelly on first, but when I did that then stuck the knife into the jar, all I ended up with was a messy knife-still wouldn't spread.<br /><br />I finally gave up and just opened my mouth, put my head back and dumped the stuff directly onto my awaiting tastebuds. On the second attempt, I somehow bypassed the tastebuds and it went directly into my throat where it strangled me.<br /><br />I'd tell this story verbally, but I am now unable to speak because it ate out my vocal cords.<br /><br />So much for convenience."
2681,"If you dislike oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will like it. If you like oatmeal made from rolled oats, try this product. You will LOVE it. You must cook this oatmeal for half an hour, so put it on before your shower. You can eat it plain if you make it thin, or you can add cream, half-and-half, whole milk, or 2% milk to thin it a bit. I also like it with a dollop of plain yogurt. Sweeten it with brown sugar or raw sugar, or just add dried fruit (dates and figs are my favorites - dried cherries are good also). Goes well also with a sprinkle of walnut pieces. But here is the best way to eat it -- better than dessert:<br /><br />Sweeten cooked oatmeal slightly with a modest amount of brown sugar, add just enough half-and-half to wet it thoroughly, and then add a healthy serving of fresh blueberries. Now THAT is some breakfast."
2682,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers.

2683,"I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called ""monosodium glutamate,"" had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When ""monosodium glutamate"" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" did not appear until ""monosodium glutamate"" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an ""industry arranged whitewash"" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers ""voluntarily"" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in ""low fat"" and ""no fat"" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using ""monosodium glutamate."" In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a ""clean label"" ingredient."
2684,"Ever since I came back from Vietnam, I have been using these small ""French presses"", or Vietnamese coffee filter sets. I bought 3 sets for one dollar (15,000 dong) in Vietnam, and soon realized that I needed more. So, I bought a few in the U.S. (local VN grocery store) and noticed that they come in different forms. This one has the screw in press, which I don't like as much as the simple press down piece that just sits on top of the ground coffee. It works great. The screw in needs to be tighten until you hit the coffee, but don't tighten too much (low drip, or no drip) and too little (too fast), but just right. I can't figure it out.<br /><br />It is much more difficult to remove the screw part after the coffee is done. Worse, sometimes it can be that it is screwed in too hard, so the water does not drain through, but now you can't loosen it, because the hot water covers the piece. That's why the simpler version works much better. I have never seen this construction in Vietnam either.<br /><br />However, there is one advantage, it is that it is sturdier and lasts longer."
2685,"I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system."
2686,"I was really skeptical at first. A lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size. After the first day, my breasts started to feel heavier, fuller, and more firm. I started at an A-cup and even with inconsistent use (maybe 2 capsules a day or less), I was reaching toward a C-cup at the end of a couple months or so. I would highly recommend this product, cause it also helps with constipation too. I stopped taking it orally because I noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts. So at the moment I'm gonna try making a rub out of it so I can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage."

2690,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys."
2691,"I bought this item at the local grocery store for $5.50 for a 9.8 oz jar which would be $16.50 for 3. I absolutely love this sweetener so I checked to see if Amazon offered it. At my surprise:<br /><br />Amazon wants nearly double that for the same amount PLUS over $10.00 in shipping for these 3 small jars!!! I am very disapointed in Amazon for this irresponsible price/shipping for this item and will not purchase this from them until they get their heads out of the clouds and offers this item for a competitive price and free shipping. If they would do this, I would do the subscribe and save option as I use this item every day. I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for Amazon's price/shipping."

2693,"I have done considerable reading on olive oil quality and sad to say, there is quite a bit of adulterated oil on the market. I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test."
2694,"(update)According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the label.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., almost matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount.""<br /><br />I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Both were almost $3.00 but only a particular brand I bought at Lucky's taste like REAL COCONUT MILK 'WATER/Milk' right out the coconut. In Asia, coconut milk comes from ""soaking the flesh of the older coconut"". But I'm not from Asia which is why I call it coconut milk & not coconut water right of the coconut.<br /><br /> Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all'. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY. My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like (flat)? And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then the meat of the coconut could be sold and not tossed out.<br /><br />As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we knew Vita CoCo must be using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare the daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)"
2695,"One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next."
2696,Go to Bell Plantation's web site and get a 4 pack for the same price.  I made the mistake of not shopping around...  You can get this for a much better price.
2697,"First, I don't taste any significant difference between this and water.  Second, I'm not drinking it for taste - I'm drinking it for the health benefits.  Fulvic Acid is a powerful antioxidant."
2698,I've made this bread a couple of times and it is very easy to make since only warm water and butter is needed in addition to the boxed ingredients.  Tastes great and I've used it for healthy sandwich bread.
2699,"Boiling water destroys the active ingredients called kavalactones.<br />I found the tea pleasant, but did not notice any of the calming effects described on the box.<br />I googled kava root and found several articles describing how the active ingredient is destroyed with hot water.<br />I am currently waiting on my cup of hot water to cool down to room temperate to try again.  I figured I would try it this way instead of throwing away the box and buying the kava root and making my own the way described in the articles."
2700,"Dear Amazon.com,<br />Please list the ingredients of products such as this, so that those of us with food allergies can purchase wisely.  What kind of oil is used? Is there dairy in the product?  I would love to try this product, but must know what is in it before I make a purchase of six boxes. Therefore, I am unqualified to rate the product since I have not tried it.<br />Many thanks!"
2701,"This past Easter, the wife and I were hosting the annual Northwest Maine ""Christ Has Risen"" BBQ.<br />Boy, that's a lot of pressure for a pair of newlyweds, so we put our heads together to think of something to ""kick it up a notch"", so to speak.<br />Well, after steering clear of putting symbolic iron nails in the cake, or hiring a Jesus look-a-like (this fine panhandling fellow is a dead ringer), we decided to take an alternate route.<br />I mean, why focus on the Messiah, when bunnies are so gosh darn cute?<br />So, the wife and I bought two dozen of these little suckers and hid them around the local park.<br />No place too tricky, you know.  Just cover it with a little dirt or leaves, toss it in a stagnant pond, etc. etc.<br />And we got all the attendees children to blindfold themselves and hop around like little rabbits and find the bunnies solely with their nose and their teeth, just like Jesus woulda done.<br />Well, we all got a kick out of it.<br />Mr. Donahue (treasurer of the church) and his wife even joined in, each having a little tug-of-war with the little rabbits legs.<br />Just a little pull and a lot of jaw strength and *pop* the little babies snap like a wishbone!<br />I have to tell you, the whole event was well received, and only two children got exceptionally sick (hence the imperfect score).<br />But besides that little hangup, these are great buys at a great price.<br /><br />Three thumbs up!  (One from me, one from the wife, and I'm sure one from the Good Lord Jesus)"
2702,"Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not. I wonder....well, I didn't have as much stress knocking my immune system down to germ take over levels maybe. Either way, I like it and I am a gonna keep it! In fact, I am going home again in 3 days....Calm, don't fail me now! :D"
2703,"First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.<br /><br />Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.<br /><br />So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!<br /><br />At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!<br /><br />We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.<br /><br />First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.<br /><br />Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).<br /><br />Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.<br /><br />SOLUTION!!<br /><br />Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.<br /><br />Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).<br /><br />For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!<br /><br />Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!<br /><br />Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).<br /><br />(2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.<br /><br />And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"
2704,This price is a rip-off--it is DOUBLE the price charged on the Keurig and Green Mountain websites.  Shame on you Amazon for endorsing this price by making it eligible for Amazon Prime.
2705,"This raw organic cacao powder came in one of those electronics static bags you'd normaly see a chipset or hard drive with a recycle symbol 7 & 11-PET, ALU, PE. I was told it was ""food-safe"" by the seller and that ""nestl&eacute; uses the exact packaging.""I don't see how ROHS (the restricted use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) can be food safe. I cannot return it for a full refund as there is a restocking fee and shipping charge so I'm writing this review.<br />  At the least, common sense should tell you that organic powderd foods should not be in contact with impregnated aluminum plastics--especially when it's stamped on the bag itself stating (ROHS compliance) ""that it contains the minimum acceptable levels of hazardous substances such as cadmium, mercury, and lead."" This is no joke. Industry cares not about your health and therefore uses recycled materials containing these hazardous metals. A packaging containing acceptable levels of hazardous materials for a landfill is not food safe!!"
2706,"What everyone who loves these needs to know is that if you have a Trader Joe's in the neighborhood and they don't stock this, or stock it intermittently, they will be quite happy to order a supply for you. That's what one of the helpful crew members at our local TJs told me, and it is definitely true. Now I have enough for a month or two (30 packages, purchased at the TJ price of $.99 each) and when I run out, I can order more."
2707,"I received this today, and this product is Made in Mexico. This is not mentioned anywhere in the description, and I would not have purchased it if I had known this. I tried to return it, and Amazon website says it is not eligible for return. I am trying to deal with their customer service now to return it, but if you are like me and do not want to eat anything which was made in Mexico, then avoid this product."
2708,"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly."

2710,"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"
2711,"I bought this so that it could pick winners in football games like the one did in the world cup (of soccer, name was Paul). I named mine Peter (or Mary, not sure how you know if its a boy or a girl octopus) but no luck, just floated upside down in the aquarium. Perhaps mine was a particularly stupid octopus or it doesn't have an opinion or it's pining for the fiords, but no luck on the sports picks.<br /><br />They really should point out that this is not a sports winner picking sort of octopus but more of a dead decoration sort. I suppose you could take it to a Detroit Red Wings game."
2712,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?"
2713,"Blends well in smoothies. Taste is, to me, neutral which is a plus for whey. Difficult to find plain whey from ""Sports"" sources and when I have the taste is not pleasant. The others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. Elderly relative was drinking bottled  nutritional mixes (Ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. They helped but smoothies are better. Make them  with whey, egg whites (Deb-El Just Whites here on Amazon sells whites in smaller packages), natural chocolate (Navitas Naturals Organic Raw Cacao Powder), bananas and other fruit. She loves them. The whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). On bad days when she can't eat solid food, I toss in a few tablespoons of Deb-El powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake."
2714,"I bought 5 bags of it thinking it would be great for working out, energy and it's protein and mineral content.  The first bag I opened was okay and I could tolerate it in shakes and sprinkled on food with hemp protein powder.  But when I opened the next few bags and shared it with a friend we both horrified from it's bitter and nasty taste.  I don't know if I just got a bad batch of this stuff.  I would only try one bag of it becausew now i am stuck with 5 bags of it!!"
2715,"I bought this after reading the raving reviews.  It is undoubtedly, healthy for you.  It also takes a lot of time to cook and you need to bring your creative side into the kitchen to make it palatable.  Since I now have several cans of this stuff (the cans are smaller than the photo appears, by the way, so check the size) to consume, I've purchased some sugar free jam to mix with it to give it (hopefully) a hint of flavor.  Quite frankly I just don't see the ""wow factor"" with this oatmeal.  I'm going to finish it since I bought it (although the idea did cross my mind to pawn it off on relatives as an unusual gift idea), but afterwards it is back to Quaker Oats for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/04/08:  I find it really interesting that when your opinion differs from the more popular ones, your review is considered ""unhelpful"" ;)"
2716,"Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!"
2717,"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed."
2718,"On  the Barry Farm Foods website, instead of listing ""yeast extract"" as on the package, they list ""autolyzed yeast"", a toxic substance that is in the same family as MSG."
2719,"After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!"
2720,"This is an excellent source of magnesium which provides a number of health benefits.  Some obvious and some not so obvious.  I have trouble sleeping, waking up many times at night and like everybody else I deal with my fair share of stress.<br /><br />I take a 1/2 teaspoon at night about an hour before bed time along with 5-htp and phenibut powder, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YY2XQE"">5-HTP Powder 10 Grams + FREE Primaforce Phenibut Powder 100 Grams</a>.  I started taking the magnesium long before the 5-htp or anything else, taking them together definitely enhances the mood and sleep stabilizing effects, if that's what your looking for.<br /><br />The Raspberry Lemon flavor doesn't taste delicious but it certainly does not taste bad so it is not a chore what-so-ever to drink a glass each night before going to bed.  Since I've started this nightly ritual nights have become more peaceful, days have become brighter (i.e. tears from stressful situations do not rear their ugly head nearly as much).  I've been happier, plain and simple."
2721,"I used this product for a few years because i thought it was organic and did not have the junk common to other broths.  How false that was.  This product is chuck full of MSG, a neurotoxin known for its adverse excitatory effects on the brain.

2722,"the liter 33.8 oz containers, which are from Thailand coconuts, taste the best. the ones in the 11.2 oz containers, which are from Brazil coconuts, have an odd after taste. although the brazil ones arent bad, they just are not as good as the thailand ones provided from ZICO, atleast."
2723,"After trying about 30 different brands of Green Tea, I have found this to be the best tasting. This Green Tea is a blend of Japanese Green Teas, which are more robust and flavourful than typical Chinese Greens. The only Green Tea I've tasted that compares is straight Yama Moto Yama from Japan. I believe Yama Moto Yama is also in the Stash blend.<br /><br />As far as Green Teas go, this blend is among the naturally sweetest and has no bitterness... unless you overcook it. The trick I have found to getting the best flavour from Green Teas is not using too high a temperature to steep it. Steep at a lower temp (170F-180F) for a longer time which will result in a tea that is actually green in colour, not brown or gold. Also, this tea tastes best as is, don't put any sweeteners in it like sugar or honey. If you are addicted to sugar, ween yourself off of it and enjoy the great flavour of this premier Green Tea.<br /><br />Of course, Green Tea is incredibly healthy, rich in anti-oxidants and relaxing theanine, is not harmfully acidic like coffee and there is also one quarter the amount of caffiene than in coffee - easier to brew too!<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable considering the quality of tea you are getting. Better yet, buy it in bulk for great savings.<br /><br />If you want to be even healthier, Stash also sells their Premium Green Tea in organic form for only a few more pennies per bag.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!"
2724,"I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Rainforest Blend Organic Arabica onecup a try this morning.<br />When I open the box I notice a similar smell as the Fog Chaser blend but not nearly as strong.<br />Oddly I find the description on the Box exactly the same as that of Fog Chaser.<br />Their Website shows this as Reguler Full city Roast and describes it as follows :<br />Our certified organic, Rainforest Blend is an artful mix of coffees from Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, and Indonesia that produces a smooth, yet full-bodied taste with lively acidic notes.<br />The onecup brews perfectly in my B70 and like it smelled befor brewing produced a more delicate cup than the fog chaser but still very flavorful when brewed.<br />Maybe this is the same blend of coffee beans only roasted alittle lighter?<br />The wife and I tend to favor the Dark Roast extra bold Kcups and on occasion Medium roasts as well.<br />This Rainforest Blend is alittle light for me but it's really flavorful and wins me over all the same.<br />So far I'm really liking these offerings from Rogers Family company and would purchase them again if the price remains competitive to Kcups.<br />I was originally concerned by the fact they are not individually sealed for freshness.<br />The wife and I normally drink 2 cups a day so we can polish off a box of 12 in three days once opened so the coffee does not lose much freshness.<br />The downside is we need to drink only these for three days in a row instead of mixing it up depending on how we feel each day as we currently do with Kcups if we want to keep them as fresh as possible."

2731,"My first thought when I saw this product was ""Yum.  These look good.  I'll order some.""  I am ALWAYS looking for a healthy, lo-cal treat.  My next thought, after reading the description was ""Why would anything sold with the name 'thinkTHIN' NOT tell you the calories in their description?""  Wouldn't just about anyone who is looking for a healthy, nutritious treat want to see the nutrition information?  Come on, people!  What are you hiding?  I will certainly NOT order these until I see more information, be it here or somewhere else.  Maybe the nutrition labeling is here, and I just don't see it, but it should be front and center."
2732,"For anyone who has a Whole Foods Grocery chain in their area, this same product sells for $12.99/case(18 cartons).  I discovered this after I paid Amazon's high price of $25!  Maybe they will adjust their price downward if more customers share competitive pricing!"
2733,"These prunes are delicious! The great thing about buying Newman's Own besides getting a heckuva great product is that all profits go to charity-Thanks Mr. Newman! Now back to the snackin'...<br /><br />Prunes aren't just for relieving constipation, they're delicious to eat and really good for you. Prunes are the best food source for antioxidants. Compared with apples:218 and oranges:750 Prunes score 5770 on the antioxidant scale.<br /><br />FYI: Antioxidants are special compounds that help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. When healthy cells are damaged, they are more susceptible to aging, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. Diets that contain fiber-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables, and are low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Prunes, which are dried plums, are a good source of fiber and make an excellent choice."
2734,"I've had this for a few weeks, and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />The hugest advantage to this system is the urine is separated from the 'litter' and odor is greatly reduced.  The litter consist of pellets similar in shape/size to the wood-based natural litters, but they are of a hard clay, which doesn't break down with moisture, and they keep their shape.  Thus, the urine drains straight down through a grid to the pad (in its own slide-out drawer), and the poo stays on top to be scooped away.<br /><br />The pee will not ferment with the characteristic stench, and you don't have to deal with clumping litter which doesn't really clump, and is just plain stinky and messy to scoop up.<br /><br />The proprietary 'pee' pads are kind of like a giant maxi pad, and absorb a lot of liquid.  Also, the bottom side of the pad is plastic, and the pad fits into the tray in a way that the plastic is upturned to keep the tray itself dry. Maintenance consists of merely taking the drawer out to the trash, and sliding the pad out, putting in a new one, and sliding the drawer back into the bottom of the box.<br /><br />The litter itself are hard pellets, which hardly get tracked, and it is 100% dustless.  A pellet or two stick to paws, but are easily picked up and tossed back into the box.  Scooping is easy, and if the poo is dry, you can kind of shake it around in the scoop to knock off some of the pellets, then throw it in the trash instead of wasting water with a toilet flush.<br /><br />It takes mere seconds to maintain the box vs. 10 minutes of scooping and scraping soggy clumping litter which doesn't really clump, but falls apart.<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter (once a month), it just pours into the trash, no scraping the soggy wet concrete of old.<br /><br />Some say you get a 'poo' smell, since kitties can't bury it quite like they did with the old type of litter, but I'll take that over the overpowering stench of fermented urine any day.  And, the smell goes away quite shortly, just like human smell in the bathroom.  Note that you should just use one bag of the pellets in the box, the litter won't be as deep.  I just give the box a quick shake daily to even it back out.<br /><br />Cat adaption to the new box:  This won't work for everyone, but this is what I did:  I set up the new Breeze system next to the old box (which was fairly gross, as I let it get bad) to see what would happen.  I placed a clump of the old litter into the new box to let him know it was 'his.'  My 9 year old fellow was pretty much using the new box right away (probably out of curiousity more than anything).  After 3 days or so, I removed the old box and inserted it directly into the garbage, never to be dealt with again.  No problems, 100% compliance on Max's part.<br /><br />If Tidy Cats came out with a fully hooded version of the box, it would be great for the folks who have standing pee-ers, but my fellow doesn't do that, so I'm lucky.<br /><br />Finally, some say the pellets and pads are expensive, but I estimate the cost as about equal to the old style of box over the long run - and the convenience and ease of maintenance should erase any other doubt.<br /><br />Also, this system has the potential of keeping tons of conventional clay litter out of landfills.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
2735,"This is an amazing find.  It tastes like brown sugar, but even better.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to affect my blood sugar levels too much, and it seems to even boost my real energy levels.<br /><br />That is because it has minerals, 17 amino acids, B vitamins, and Vitamin C in it.  It is not processed, which is why it is so good overall, I think."

I called and asked them to mail me a cap for the plastic bottle, so I may dispense & use the oil.  No cap came.  With other companies available online, and an opportunity to make a comment, I waited over a month to post a comment.  These people need to  a) ship in a way to protect your purchase  b) replace what they send and is recived broken.  Won't be back.  (you know, first time, shame on you.  second time, shame on me...)

2738,"I'm still trying to find a Dutch processed cocoa as rich and flavorful as the no longer available Hershey's European Cocoa (Silver Label) which was cheap in comparison to some of the other Dutch processed cocoas I've tried since.<br /><br />This is MUCH better than Droste (which, in my opinion, is tasteless)-<br />It is  better than Penzys, slightly better than Double-Dutch Dark from King Arthur, but not as good as Bensdorp."
2739,"I have been a fan of Jasmine Tea for quite a while.  Several years ago,<br />I had my first taste of TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea, and fell in love with the<br />sweet, delicate flavour....totally different from even the ""English Breakfast Tea"" made by the same company.  Though ""English Breakfast Tea"",<br />(and ""Darjeeling"", and even Fortum & Mason's ""Royal Blend"" tea are different from the usual ""Orange Pekoe"" or ""Orange Pekoe and Black"" teas, one usually gets bagged in the supermarket, these other 'rarified' teas are far more like the usual tea than Jasmine Tea.  Jasmine Tea, (at least as made by Twinnings), will always be my total favourite.<br /><br />When I went to purchase some ""TWINNINGS Jasmine Tea"" through Amazon, they were out of it...thank goodness, as it turns out, temporarily.  I didn't know this at the time...and so, I bought the ""substitute"" then offered...Sunflower Jasmine Tea.  I figured that Jasmine Tea is Jasmine Tea, no matter who makes it ....right?  And this Sunflower Tea DID seem slightly less expensive....so, I bought some.<br /><br />I have just had my first cup.  It did NOT taste like the Jasmine Tea I so remember and appreciate.  This is a very, very PALE tea in colour....and what is worse, the taste is somewhat peppery, (ulgh!)....with only the VERY slightest hint of the wonderful Jasmine Tea Flavour I remember.<br /><br />WHAT went wrong, I wondered.  HOW could this be so different?  Tea trees<br />should know no nationality or political system!  I was extremely bewildered and confused....for about five minutes.  But I found out the reason, (I think), just before I started to write this review...seeking out the Sunflower Jasmine Tea for which I wanted to write a review.<br /><br />Amongst the ""Jasmine Teas"" listed are TWO TYPES of Twinnings Jasmine Tea.<br />One is ""Jasmine Tea"", the other ""Jasmine Green Tea"".  I suspect that THIS is the reason I so dislike the Jasmine Tea from Sunflower.  It is NOT ""straight"" Jasmine Tea...but MUST be Jasmine Green Tea.  And although Green Tea is said to have myriad health benefits, it sure doesn't make as tasty and satisfying a brew as Jasmine tea.  Even when, it seems, it is MIXED with Jasmine Tea.<br /><br />One would expect people in the People's Republic of China to know the difference!  And to label their tea accordingly!  Not everyone, (including me!) is a tea expert...and the difference between ""Jasmine Tea"" and ""Jasmine Green Tea"" should be noted on the tea-box label, for tea novices, such as I...as it is, thoughtfully, by Twinnings Teas.  I am, at present, extremely disappointed at the carelessness in labeling.<br />Those who want ""Jasmine Tea"" only will, I am sure, be likewise disappointed by this probably-mislabeled-by-mistake-or-by-carelessness ""Jasmine Tea"".  It is NOT ""Jasmine Tea"" to my palate -- it is, I am almost certain, ""Jasmine Green Tea"".  There is SUCH a difference in taste!!!!!!<br /><br />I know Green Tea is good for one, and so I will keep this tea.  I will combine it with the ""ordinary"" tea I find at the supermarket -- and which I find far more flavourful!  (NOTE: Second cup of tea -- even mixed with ""ordinary"" orange pekoe tea, (two tea-bags!), is not to my taste.  Therefore....as is listed in the ""NOTE: PS"",  below, I HAVE DECIDED I AM NOT KEEPING this tea, but am putting it up for sale, for those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, (obviously some people do, as reflected in the other, sterling reviews of this tea), and would like it -- 1 pound minus two servings -- at a bargain price.)<br /><br />However, this tea is certainly not to MY taste.  And so disappointed am I, that, unless there is a very, very great difference in price, I will stick to buying genuine,<br />""JASMINE Tea"", from Twinnings, (who takes the time and trouble to carefully label each TYPE of Jasmine Tea), from now on -- even if Sunflower does decide to mend it's ways and re-label its tea!<br /><br />A great flavor disappointment -- due to careless labelling!<br /><br />.............................................................<br />.............................................................<br /><br />p.S.  NOTE:  Today, 12th March, 2009 -- two days after I have written this review -- and about 6 days after I have received this tea, I have FINALLY seen that, yes indeedy....the package DOES say, ""Green Tea With Jasmine Flowers"" -- on the BACK of the tin, in smallish lettering!  One cannot see the BACK of the tin from the Amazon.com illustration!  From the ""Product Description"", it states that ""Jasmine Tea is one of the most pleasant-tasting green teas available...."" -- but does NOT mention any differentiation between the two varieties: ""Jasmine Tea"", ane ""Jasmine Green Tea"" -- as Twinnings Teas thoughtfully does.  Even from the ""Proudct Description"", which probably has been supplied by Sunflower, a novice would STILL not know there are two distinct and different TYPES of Jasmine Tea!  AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE TWO VARIETIES: - I have been on the phone with my sister, and she concurs: she (also), LOVES plain Jasmine Tea, but detests Jasmine GREEN Tea.  But -- I suppopose there ARE those who enjoy Jasmine Green Tea, looking at the ohter sterling reviews of this same tea.<br /><br />I don't like it. But I'm glad that there are those who do like it.  I have had two cups of 5his tea -- and have revised my opinion about keeping it.  I am putting it up for sale, via my Amazon.com shop.  I may lose mnney in this transaction, but better that, (for me), than suffering through more of this Jasmine Green Tea.  Besides, there PROBABLY ARE others who like it.  I guess I'll not only be doing myself a favour -- but will also be doing my ""good deed"" for the day, by putting it up at a bargain price for those who truly enjoy Jasmine GREEN Tea!  If you want to buy it, it's here -- used only twice, at the aforesaid bargain price! (Hey, that rhymes!)<br /><br />Note to Sunflower Teas:  PLEASE LABEL YOUR TEAS MORE CAREFULLY FROM NOW ON!"
2740,"I need pure light malt extract...  In powder form.  No where in the description does it state this is liquid!...

2741,"To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words ""Medium Extra Bold"" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other."
2742,"Received these and made a stir fry dish the same night.  Noodles have a texture all their own and I LOVE them (husband likes them, too).  They are basically tasteless on their own and they pick up flavors from the dish they are in so spicy dishes are the perfect place for these noodles.  So far I've used them in stir-frys and soups.  These noodles have No calories and zero carbs after you minus the fiber, how wonderful is that !!!!!  If you're looking for this noodle to taste just like regular pasta, it won't. BUT if you like trying new things and learning to use new foods, these noodles are the way to go.  Besides, knowing these have no calories and zero net carbs makes me a happy ""dieting"" camper."
2743,"I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change. Before considering surgery, we decided to give some natural methods a try. After doing some research, we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazon.com. Since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before, which didn't work, we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results. Here is what we picked out.....<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOJ7S0"">Ainterol Pueraria Mirifica 500Pure Breast Capsules (100 caps)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D9AW"">Wild Yam Root 180 vcaps</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETA6W"">Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed 610 mg, Capsules 180ea</a><br />These are the ingredients that we sort of liked and decided to give them all a try. So I guess this review is for all three of them at the same time. She has been taking them for just over two months now and we both agree that we have seen a change. Her bust has grown by a little over two inches and her breasts definately fell and have more fullness to them. She is a lot more confident and says that her shirts sit on her much nicer. Now she has an extra excuse to spend a ton of money shopping for new clothes, but what can I say, I just love her. A little bit of caution, there are a couple of changes that happened after she started to take the combination of all three of those pills. Her natural body smell has changed a little, nothing negative of course or she would have stopped taking them, but it has altered just a little. And she sometimes complains that her boobs are a little sore. But there has been a significant size difference and I believe that this stuff works. Good luck to you ladies and guys remember to love your women, they're just as sensitive about their boobs as we are about our penises!"
2744,"I love most Bob's Red Mill products and have been buying from them for 10+ years.  However, this is my least favorite of their products.  This stuff is easy to cook with, it's true, but it tastes like rubber, smells bad when it's cooking, and has no flavor until you add your own spices.  I have no idea why I used to cook with this stuff so often other than that I didn't know much about cooking in HS and it looked ""high protein"" on the label.  I recently read The Whole Soy Story by Kaayla Daniel (Amazon has it), and was amazed to learn that processed soy products like TSP are processed at high temperatures, denaturing the proteins and leaving in loads with antinutrients that damage the thyroid among many other health problems they cause.  Although TSP appears to be almost all protein (like meat or tofu), in reality, you don't absorb much of the protein, anyway.  While I am glad Bob's is using organic soybeans to make their TSP (thereby leaving out the pesticides and genetically engineered ingredients), the fact that it's ""organic"" doesn't make it a healthy or even a safe product.  The dangerous antinutrients in soy are not a chemical additive or pesticide, they are in intrinsic part of the beans themselves, the plant's natural way of deterring pests.  Traditional foods made from soy and eaten over the past 400+ years were slow cooked and fermented, destroying the antinutrients and leaving the protein, vitamins, and minerals intact.  TSP is the total opposite of whole, healthy, fermented soy products like tempeh or miso soup, as it is not fermented and leaves in all the antinutrients.  As a longtime vegan on a gluten-free diet because of food allergies, I'll continue to buy other Bob's products (they have an amazing gluten-free line), but I am saddened they are still making highly-processed, extremely unhealthy items like TSP."

2752,"I have been using Greenies for years, including the older formula that reportedly had digestion problems. However, we never have had any problems with Greenies. Just make sure you get the appropriate size for your dog. I have never seen a dog that could resist a Greenie. They will start doing tricks never seen before once you bring them into the house. They do help with their breath, teeth cleaning and training and we normally use them as ""well earned"" treats (they aren't the cheapest thing in the treat world). I just ordered 4, 27 oz. tubs of the Teenies (we have Papillons) and I know our dogs will enjoy every one of them. Never have to worry about our dogs getting fat eating these as we do not give them multiple times a day. The new formula reportedly has solved the digestibility problem and the manufacturer claims is now more digestible than normal dog food. In the original formula, the problem usually involved incidents when dogs just tried to swallow them whole or get it down in 2 bites. Our dogs always chewed them into small pieces avoiding any problems. Believe me, your dogs will love them."

2755,"Yogurt made with this starter and organic whole milk is simply the best I have ever tasted. It does not have the thin, sour taste that most of the single-culture starters produce. The taste is instead smooth and full-bodied. It is also thicker than most when a little dry milk is added. The process takes a bit longer, since the milk must be heated to 180 degrees, then cooled to 75. The cooling requires an ice-water bath, or the temperature would never get that low in our kitchen. After 12 hours in the Yogourmet Multi, which starts at room temperature and very gradually increases to 112 degrees, the yogurt is perfect every time. It is so good that it makes a good dessert all by itself, and is even better mixed with fruit. Combined with mayonnaise, it makes a fine potato or carrot-raisin salad. Smoothies are really smooth. Give it a try in your favorite recipe. You will love it!"

2757,"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,""<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."""
2758,"Everyone needs to read about safflower oil and the CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) it contains.  Safflower oil greatly assists in the loss of belly fat, combined with a healthy diet and exercise routine.  I had plateaud at around the low 150's for about 6 months. I thought this was where my body really wanted to be, and I should just make my peace with it. Then I discovered the Shangri-La Diet and then picked safflower oil.  In 2 weeks I dropped 6 pounds and it's still falling like a rock. Mind you, I've continued my well-balanced diet and my high intensity exercise routine 3-4 days a week. I haven't changed anything else about my lifestyle. Take one tablespoon in the afternoon as your mid-afternoon ""snack"" and then one tablespoon at night before bed, and wash it down with water. It's been a true lifesaver.  I have also read about taking CLA pills, but it would be better (and cheaper) to go for the source."

I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"

2768,"Darn, you people are having alot of fun reviewing this item....<br /><br />Personally, I don't know why some people get so offended by the consumption of rabbit.  (I guess it's the cows and pigs and chickens' own darn fault for not being small, cute, and fuzzy...).  Rabbits are very healthy, and they are actually helping with some hunger issues in developing countries.  But again, if only cows and chickens were cute and fuzzy, too....<br /><br />With that said, I'm a vegetarian.  I find it rather hippocritical since alot of the people who get so offended with the consumption of rabbit would be perfectly OK with the consumption of beef or pork.  Especially, beef, for example, causes alot of enviromental damage to the world and many end up living a far from favorable lives before the final slaughter due to supply and demand.<br /><br />No, I'm not saying that you should all go vegetarian as well, nor am I encouraging everyone to grab a knife and fork and start chasing after bunnies.  I'm just saying... that rejecting so harshly on the simple notion that you think it is gross is rather close minded.  Just saying that it's not for you would have been sufficient."

2770,I have never bought tahini before but just had to try this product because of the rave reviews.  I'm glad I did.  My hummus was spectacular.  This tahini is so creamy and silky on the tongue...quite a culinary experience.  Try it!
2771,"I use these frequently.  Calorie and carbohydrate free, but just as filling as spaghetti.  Although they don't taste like standard pasta, they're a wonderful substitute for when you have carb cravings.  The fishy smell rinses right away and they absorb the flavor of the sauce.  A little on the strange side with texture - 'rubbery' sounds worse than it is, but I can't figure out another description.  Still really enjoy them.  I use udon seasoning packets or boullion usually, but pasta sauce works well. I find that if you rinse and prepare them, then allow to sit an hour or so to absorb the flavor, it works really well.  Toss them in the microwave and voila!  Great product."
2772,"These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.  We found out that the company has moved to a new factory/producer and that the formula has changed in some ways.  The flavor is not as fresh and tastes more like processed food. We are really disappointed and are hoping that the company can somehow find its way back to making really great bars."
2773,"As a 100-year-old vinegar, this is a wonderful addition to your gourmet pantry.  I drizzle it on chunks of Parmigiano-Reggiano, berries, Cheetos, walnuts, and other high-class foods.  I also have a hardwood floor, and adding 1 teaspoon of this vinegar to a gallon of water makes a good floor cleaner also."
2774,"This stuff WORKS for not only relaxing the muscles, but majorly helps PMS, Menopause symptoms, Hubby and I take it several nights a week. It helps us to sleep easier and deeper, too.<br /> It is a lot better than the Natural Calm without Calcium."
2775,"When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant ""Perfect, couldn't be better"", and five points<br />indicated ""Don't like this one"".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee."
2776,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price."

2778,"I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today. They are light and you cannot taste any fat or grease after eating them. That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"
2779,"These were a staple for my gluten-free teenager until a few months ago when she started complaining that they tasted different, not in a good way.

2780,"I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar."
2781,"I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 6 MONTHS NOW. WHEN I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM THE US POST OFFICE, THE CANS WERE ALL CRUSHED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. USUALLY MY SHIPMENT COMES VIA UPS AND THE CONDITION IS ALWAYS GOOD. WHEN I OPENED THE ONE OF THE CANS  I CUT THE SKIN INSIDE MY THUMBNAIL. I WAS BLEEDING FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES. I FEEL THAT AMAZON SHOULD COMPENSATE FOR THIS INJURY."
2782,"Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page. This is just to advise those pet parents if your kiddo has a poultry or chicken allergy like mine do that every variety to date contains both chicken and natural chicken flavor.<br />The ingredients are as followed for the Super Antioxidant variety<br />Ingredients:<br />Organic brown rice flour, rice flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch, chicken, natural chicken flavor, organic oat fiber, organic flaxseed, pectin (apple), dehydrated carrots, cranberries, l-ascrobyl-2polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), parsley, chia seed, carrageenan (natural seaweed extract), blueberry pomace, pomegranate, mixed tocopherols (natural source of vitamin E), green tea extract (decaf)."
2783,"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

2784,"I discovered Beet Juice when I went to Whole Foods in search of a natural source of Iron. I was eight months pregnant at the time and anemic and I have a terrible time taking synthetic iron without throwing up. Anyway, I went in looking for something and the clerk told me this was the best source. I took her word for it and took these home, and I'm glad I did. These are awesome! Within a few days of taking this I felt remarkably better. I did a bit of reading about the benefits of beet juice, and there's not much it isn't good for. Its really considered a super food its so potent as an antioxident. It is also remarkable for vein support, regulating blood sugar and blood pressure. It is also good for replacing blood after surgery and it is a powerful anticancer food. It also is really high in fiber so it counteracts the usual problem associated with taking iron--constipation. The great thing about taking the supplement is there is no way you can eat enough beets to get all these benefits, so supplementing is the way to go!! I took these on a empty stomach before bed and it never bothered my stomach. Don't hesitate to try these. In the capsule form these are easy to swallow and much cheaper than synthetic iron pills. I'm still taking them because of all the health benefits they offer."
2785,"Especially for this price, I expected this product to arrive in the famous white box with the individual cups and the map in the lid, NOT loose in a brown cardboard box with a scrap of white wax paper between the tape and the loose jelly beans.  No ziplock bag, not even cheap clear plastic bag, just the brown cardboard box (the outside was white).  Yes, the website says to read everything carefully.  No, there is no picture of a Jelly Belly box.  I just had my own expectations, and I wanted to give you my opinion.<br /><br />Good luck."
2786,"I used this product on toast instead of butter, I used it to cook curry chicken. I used it to scramble eggs. I used it to flat iron my hair (smooth) i used it on my skin (mmm). Good vaginal lubricant too. Also great for oil pulling. I read it can be used with baking soda as a natural toothpaste? Haven't tried that one yet. This product is well worth the money for its many uses."
2787,"This arrived in wonderful condition. I am writing this review weeks later because I wanted to be able to say how it held up and I am happy to report it is doing fantastic. This is a slow-grower, but I have no trouble getting what I need off it for my recipes. If you use a lot of bay in cooking you may want to get a couple of them. The company is top notch - they pack the plants well and ship timely."
2788,"The food is GREAT.  The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.  BUT....what Amazon doesn't bother to mention is that ""quantities are limited"".  I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months.  It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day).<br /><br />I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told ""there's a problem"".  Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.<br /><br />I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Amazon.  NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit.  So I'm here to tell you there is.<br /><br />The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here."
2789,"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these!"
2790,this is a great gift-for someone who really needs nothing<br />or actually appreciates a beautiful and tasty treat.<br />Don't waste on those without keen senses!This is not inexpensive but when you look at what you might finally come up with after searching stores and then need to mail it-<br />this then is a decent price!<br /> And it will be remembered -as from you!
2791,cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin B12 is in the product.<br />We wonder why cancer among kids is raising...we are not eating food anymore<br />but synthetic toxic crap.<br />Despicable! Bought it ounce will never buy it again!<br /><br />You better off with an organic egg/yellow preferably from a real farmer<br /><br />answer: methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin (that is the best of the best)<br /><br />Do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the FDA if you do not want to be flamed<br />do you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you.
2792,"This is an excellent price for high-quality, organic, Grade B, Kosher maple syrup. It is 100% maple syrup, with no other additives. It is certified Kosher by KOF-K and is organically grown in New England. Grade B maple syrup is excellent for pouring on waffles or pancakes and is also tasty added to baked goods. It has a deeper, richer flavor than dark, medium or light grade A syrup.<br /><br />I highly recommend the seller, Swanson, whom I've had frequent dealings with. They have a large website and sell a wide variety of health products, both supplements and health foods like this syrup. They have always processed my orders on their website quickly, and the orders have arrived promptly, with no delivery problems."
2793,"These are high-quality pilchard sardines wild-caught from Morocco and contain 2g of heart-healthy Omega-3 fatty acids per can.  They are boneless and skinless and ready-to-eat.  My favorite way of eating sardines is crushed with some extra virgin olive oil and hot sauce (Jamaican pickapeppa sauce is ideal), on top of crackers.  Buying a whole case of 25 cans is much more economical than buying individual cans of comparable quality at our local supermarket.  We're very happy that Amazon sells these sardines."
2794,"I am the newest fan of the BLK water.  I am uncertain what water the other people are drinking but certainly they have an air for the ridiculously exaggerated.  The BLK water is very clean tasting and yes it has faint taste of minerals but nothing like what some of the haters have posted.  It does NOT taste like 1. motor oil 2. old stump water, or any other absurd examples posted.  Yes the water is completely black but that is about it.  I find it chic looking in fact and the fact that it normalizes my pH levels are the plus plus and worth buying factor.  The price point is also nothing sticker shocking.  It is what you would pay for any other specialty water available on the market.  I intend on continuing to buy BLK water and take in the benefits of the dark side.  As for the folks with some over the top gnarly reviews, please stop with the lies."
2795,"I recently purchased a couple of cases of this when Amazon had it on sale.  I'd never tried it before, but since it's healthy, I thought I'd give it a whirl and pawn it off on somebody else if I didn't like it.  When I opened my first bottle, I thought it had a really strange, fermented taste and smell -- yes, sadly, I tried a sip of it -- and had a lot of thick, gooey pulp.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer @ (415) 775-6355 and asked them if this was normal.  Apparently, they had a bad batch with their old manufacturing plant where the bottles were not being sealed properly and have since spoiled.  She asked me some questions about the bottle, got some order numbers and cap numbers from me, and they are sending me out some replacement cases.  They were very friendly, apologetic and helpful.  So if you get some from Amazon and the taste seems to be off, I'd encourage you to call them and let them rectify the situation for you."
2796,I placed the order on 12/6/09 and here it is 12/31/09 and I never received it. When I tried to track the order UPS does not have the tracking number in the database cause the number is bogus. for some reason I cannot contact the merchant to tell them what's going on so I have to dispute the charge on my credit card.
2797,This soup sounded delicious and nutritious until I read that it contained so much monosodium glutamate.  Why would manufacturers deliberately try to poison their customers!  Monosodium glutamate is a well known and studied NEUROTOXIN!  Can't they just use REAL FOOD flavorings to keep the product tasty and well received by all consumers?  I really wanted to try this soup since it looked terrific and most ingredients were excellent but I won't buy it until they stop using MSG like it's salt and pepper.
2798,"these are not the originals they are produced in Hungary and not Germany and taste differently. There are not bad at all, but they are not the same as the originals from Germany despite the fact they are produced in a Haribo factory."
2799,"These oatmeal squares are delicious! They are chewy and you can taste the chocolate chips on every bite. I first got hooked on these due to Costco. Unfortunately, the Costco around the house stop selling these. Lucky for me, I found the squares on Amazon. I bought a box of these in November of 2010 and the best by date on the squares is June 2011. It looks like it has a shelf life of 6 to 7 months.<br /><br />These squares are 190 Calories, fat is 50 calories (6 grams), sodium 110 mg, total carb 28 grams, sugar 13 grams, and protein is 6 grams.<br /><br />(Update 10/2/2011)<br />Well, it appears Corazonas changed how they made the oatmeal squares. The squares are on my 'Subscribe and Save' list from Amazon and the last two monthly shipments I noticed some changes. It is now less sweet, less chewy, more thicker/airy, and more dry then before. I still think the squares are good and will continue to have them on my 'Subscribe and Save' list, but I do prefer the old recipe.<br /><br />(Update 12/6/2011) Back to the old recipe!!! Hopefully, I just had a bad batch."
2800,"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier."
2801,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public.  For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net.  What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.  People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage.  It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food.  What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.  It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food.  The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing).  I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One.  It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.  Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result.  It's worth it."
2802,"All the box's seem to have the same items? Only a few differences, and they say they have the right to substitute? All the pictures are the same 1960 box, Whats going on here?"
2803,I bought this and I could not recall why.  When I use it for cooking it makes the food taste like coconut.  So cannot see using it a lot.  I love coconut but not on quesadias.  Instead I ordered coconut pills.
2804,"Timothy's Colombian Decaffeinated is a good tasting coffee for a good price.  The savings are even better if you sign up for the auto renew program.  Also, we have found that you can use each cup twice.  Therefore it's like getting twice the quantity for the money.  I checked with the Keurig company and they said by processing the cups for two cups of coffee or tea will not hurt the machine.<br /><br />  Best, Al"
2805,"These brand is made in Lebanon, some say the Lebanese make the sweetest rose water. This product is Made from 100% distilled rose petals (ive seen some w/additives). Packaged in glass bottle. And of course you can use the product from baking to air freshener to perfume for the ladies.<br /><br />If your comparing prices when all is said and done, you should not pay more than $1.25(USD)per ounce of rose water."
2806,"Ordered ""Dark Magic K-Cup - Box of 2"". Therefore should be each box of 24 x 2 = 48 K-cups. I only received 1 box of 24. The company changes its name frequently and sends wrong quantity. Beware of non- Amazon sellers. Amazon contacted and will investigate the fraud. However, Amazon has easy return process."
2807,"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."
2808,"The Nutiva coconut oil was not moisturizing, which wasn't a surprise since oil doesn't moisturize, it just coats whatever you put it on. As such, once you moisturize your skin then apply coconut oil, this can help slow down the evaporation of the moisture into the air. That is great if you are less than 30 years old.  At 50+ I actually want and need moisture. I used this product faithfully for 6 weeks and all it did was smooth my legs for about an hour and then they were parched and dried looking again because I hadn't actually added moisture. My legs also felt greasy and had a faint odor of coconut. I don't really want a 2-step process of using a moisturizer on my legs then coating them with coconut oil.  As a face moisturizer it just made my face break out (yuuuuck!). As for the taste, I'll just say that butter has nothing to fear from this stuff. I really can't believe I fell for the hype and wasted my money with this purchase."
2809,The description on this item says it's 3 years old and 9 inches tall...the one that arrived is 5.5 inches at it's highest point (including the container). The tree itself is just under 3 inches tall. It is a pretty tree but not at all as described. I would return it except that I don't have time to get another in time for Christmas but I am very disappointed.
2810,"This product is wonderful!  For a low-fat, low calorie alternative to peanut butter, this is the one.  I use the chocolate version - cocoa added.  It is still 90% peanut butter taste, with just a hint of cocoa and a little better color.  If you mix it with a little extra water, you have a good peanut dip or sauce for cooking."
2811,"I had not realized until just now that these FERRERO ROCHER HAZELNUT CHOCOLATES 48 COUNT GIFT BOX, were made by the SAME Ferrero Company that makes ""Nutella"" Hazelnut-Chocolate spread, (which I totally love to eat!)  I had some of these individual chocolates once, and did NOT like them!  Those who share my taste in chocolates will not like them either!  For these Ferraro Rochet Hazelenut<br />Choclolates, have bits of hazel nuts, (finely chopped...but NOT finely chopped enough for me), embedded in a chocolate coating, the whole surrounding a whole hazelnut.  I'm one of those people who likes FILETS....boneless fish filets, boneless chicken filets, etc.  I, (and I know I'm NOT alone here), like my chocolate mixtures to be complete MIXTURES....like Nutella spread, (or ""figaro"" hazelnut chocolate pieces...also called ""chocolate truffles"").  Biting through<br />hard, embedded ""pieces"" of things -- even such tiny pieces of hazelnut as the chocolate-hazelnut coating has here -- is NOT for me, or others like me.  In this, I have discovered, I, (or make that, ""we""), have true ""preppy"" tastes, (even though I did attend plain old Queens College in NYC -- part of the very public<br />City University of New York where, it seems, (to me, at least), egalitarian has gone from good to exremes -- and even fraternities and sororities are officially outlawed!  To some, this may seem only ""fair"" and ""equitable"".  But to status-seeking me, it seems SO unglamourous!  I guess I'm not the typical Queens College of the City University of New York student, though I do sincerely laud them for making eduction more available for everyone.  I only wish they had more of what private universities have.  To me, ""equality"" is equal luxuries for all, not equal utilitarianism for all.  Same goal, different methods, I guess....)  In ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", it states that preppies like filets...no bones to slice through, or fat to trim away. (Why waste the time, why spend the effort?)  The same has to go, (at least for me --and others with ""preppy"" tastes), for these otherwise ""gourmet"" quality confections.  Those little bits of chopped hazelnuts in the coating -- not to mention the BIG hazelnut in the centre -- make eating DIFFICULT, and spoil the pleasure of eating. Rather than have a (fancy) chocolate that I must chew through, I would prefer a plain old Hershey choclate bar. It, like the more expensive Nutella, IS a chocolate ""filet"".  I suppose this liking of the ""ordinary"" Hershey bar, (and a plain one please -- not one with almonds),  proves I am NOT a snob -- I, (and others like me), simply have TASTE!<br /><br />I thought I was alone in this.  But since reading ""The Official Preppy Handbook"", I know that others -- far richer than myself -- also have these tastes.  This, of course, vindicates me, and I feel glad of it.<br />Enjoy ""Ferrero Rocher Hazelnut Chocolates 48 Count Gift Box"" if you wish...and give it to friends, if that is your desire. But this sort of chocolate, because of the way it is formed, is NOT my choice for either myself or my friends.  And, no matter how excellent the chocolate itself is, it will NEVER be of ""gourmet"" quality, to me!"
2812,"Although I've been a vegetarian and even vegan at times in my life, currently I'm not.  I was so happy to find this great price on Bob's Red Mill TVP.  It's less than half of what I'd pay at my local grocery store--and only one of the stores in my area regularly even carries it.<br /><br />If you worry about both health and price, TVP is a great addition to your diet. I use it in conjunction with ground beef.  I rehydrate it using beef stock, and then add it to my ground beef.  If you're new to TVP, I'd start with rehydrating 1/4 to 1/2 cup and adding it to one pound of beef.  You can go up to a 50/50 blend--and most people will not be able to tell the difference, especially in things like chili and meatballs.  My kids and husband have no idea. :)<br /><br />If you buy the 80/20 ground beef--by mixing it with no-fat, high protein, high fiber TVP, you will halve the fat you eat per serving.  Because it doubles the amount of beef you get, you can also use this as a way to buy free-range or lower fat meat for your family.  Although $4 or $5/pound is a lot for many families--by cutting it with TVP, your true cost is $2-$2.50.  Much more affordable.<br /><br />I really recommend giving it a try. You can buy one cup at the bulk foods section of many health food stores to give it a try. Definitely hydrate it with beef stock for added flavor.  If your family likes it, then buy it on Amazon.  Good luck!"
2813,"Beware, these small bars have nearly as many calories and fat as a candy bar.<br /><br />Taste of the chocolate coconut chew variety is best described as bittersweet cocoa mixed with lard."
2814,"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind."
2815,"I bought these to use with a Handpresso portable espresso maker.  The first few shots that I made came out a bit too quickly (as others have mentioned) and had a slightly wattery taste with very little crema.<br /><br />THIS ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED!<br /><br />After the first few shots, I decided to add some additional tamping pressure to the pod by pressing down on it with a solid object (I found that a mason jar or coffee mug both worked great) with the hopes that this would increase brewing time and provide a more satisfying shot.<br /><br />It worked, and now my shots come out perfect, with good flavor and tons of crema.  I have to give these pods four stars for the poor tamping, but fortunately this is something that can be resolved quite easily."
2816,"I am rating this as a one because it is not GF. I had a different experience with Barry Farms than the previous person. I called Barry Farms as soon as I received my product. I,too, needed GF. They were extremely friendly and are giving me a full refund. The woman explained to me that their distributor for the GF product stopped producing, and they are trying to resource. They know that they need to change the Amazon picture."
2817,"If you only read one thing about Green Mountain's hot cocoa, make it this: Don't ever use these K-Cups on a larger setting.<br /><br />When used on the standard setting, almost all of the powder in the Green Mountain cups gets used (unlike Timothy's White Chocolate cups), and produces an acceptable cup of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's not much better than a Swiss Miss packet that you'd mix in hot water, but the convenience of slamming a cup in your Keurig and having a cup of cocoa in less time than it takes to microwave some water is pretty nice. And if that's your goal, this is a pretty good buy.<br /><br />However, if you're expecting massive chocolate flavor or a ""gourmet"" experience, these K-Cups are guaranteed to disappoint. Using two on the small setting might get you by, but that brings your cost per cup around a buck, which is pretty steep for what you're getting."
2818,"I've worked with different types of fondants and if you are reading reviews because you are new to the Fondant Cake process, here are some things to keep in mind:<br />1. Satin Ice is Yummier than most<br />2. Satin Ice is harder to work with than many<br />3. Satin Ice shouldn't be you're first ;)<br /><br />I started my Fondanting adventures using Wilton's, a brand that makes most professional cake decorators cringe. It isn't yummy, but it is forgiving. If you are new to cake-ing I would recommend using Wilton's the first few times to get the hang of things before moving to the more finicky fondants. If you start by using this fondant, you may be Freudianly misspronouncing it in a loud voice: ""I hate you SATAN Ice!!"" Really, fondant tears may stain your cheeks.<br /><br />Fondants I've used in order of easiest to work with:<br />1. Wilton's<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. Homemade Marshmallow<br /><br />Fondant's I've worked with in order of yummieness:<br />1. Homemade Marshmallow<br />2. Elite by Fondx<br />3. Satin Ice<br />4. (distantly) Wilton's<br /><br />I would recommend the tutorial on Satin Ice website, really great:<br />[...]<br /><br />If you are only buying Satin Ice to sculpt edible animals, than this would be a great one. For first time cake coverings, try Wilton's, get things down then come back to Satin Ice.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck on your cake adventures!<br /><br />Jackie<br />domesticfits (dot) com"
2819,"Being allergic to dairy, gluten and not wanting to eat soy due to the health problems associated with heavy soy consumption, I looked into hemp protein as a source of easily digestible protein to help bulk up when working out.<br /><br />Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised and have ordered 4 more canisters of ruth's hemp protein powder(2 just hemp, 2 with sprouted flax) and will order more of the Maca when I run out as this one contains Maca and it's advisable to only take 5g of Maca per day(1 serving of this has 5g) since it's just an effective energy booster.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad at all. I mix a scoop of the powder with some unsweetened almond milk, just a bit of fruit and some chia seeds and it tastes good. It does have a bit of an earthy taste, a kick of sorts but it doesn't bother me at all and I'm glad that you don't have to add tons of sugary fruit to cover up the taste.<br /><br />As far as how it works, the powder is a great meal replacement or another meal if you're trying to gain weight. The powder itself provides 11g of Protein(with the sprouted flax one providing 13g and the standalone hemp powder one providing 15g) and they all have about 120-140 calories so adding 2 scoops, some milk and some fruit and even some nuts is a good calorie boost. It also provides a lot of energy due to the protein being easily assimilated and the maca being an excellent energy booster on its own.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this thing is a champ with a great Omega 6:Omega 3 ratio(3:1 which is the optimal healthy range) as well as being a great source of dietary fiber to keep the intestinal tract healthy and having many vitamins and minerals(being an excellent source of Zinc and Vitamin E, 2 minerals which can be hard to get in our daily diets). Overall, this a great product that I recommend wholeheartedly and will continue to use for a while."
2820,"This is a great product but it is item is way overpriced here.  The can is much, much smaller than it appears in the photo.  I thought for sure that they had made a mistake when I opened the box.  This can is less than half the size of what they sell at my local health food store.  This is a very, very, small can.  It is only 1.06 ounces.<br /><br />At my local health food store, normally very expensive as it is a small store, they charge only $1 more for a 2.82 oz can.<br /><br />ALSO, YOU CAN NOT RETURN THIS ITEM.  THEY MUST KNOW THEY ARE RIPPING YOU OFF SO THEY MAKE IT A DO NOT RETURN ITEM.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BE RIPPED OFF."
2821,"When I was a kid I ate slim jims all the time.<br /><br />I am glad that they still taste the same.<br />Unfortunately, nowadays they like to change and mess with too many of the things that we grew up with and loved as children.<br /><br />Here's what I used to do (and still do): I get the end real wet until the skin gets to the point that you can slough it off without breaking it. I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!"
2822,"I'm a fan of regular rice Krispies, but this cereal is something gone horribly wrong.  It is much too sweet and has a really bad flavor to it - I'm not really sure how to describe it.  I'm a fan of lucky charms, cookie crisp, etc .. but I just can not eat this stuff."
2823,"This stuff is way too expensive for what it is. I mean, seriously, how do people actually eat this. I had it this morning with some poached eggs and even a healthy amount of hollandaise couldn't make it taste good."
2824,"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"
2825,"We gave this to our one month old son until yesterday, and then found out that the formula we have been giving him since birth was recalled.  He wasn't doing too well on it.  I can't imagine how quality control failed such a major corporation in baby formula.  We switched to the Target brand, and surprisingly (or maybe not), our baby is doing much better now.  We will never trust or go back to the Similac brand (any type)."
2826,"I LOVE SLIM JIMS. THEY TASTE GREAT AND THEY ARE GREAT FOR SNACKS. AND THEY ARE SMALL SO IT IS EASY TO CARY THEM AROUND IF YOU WANT TO EAT THEM IN A CAR,IN A PLANE,ON A BUS OR ANYWHERE ON THE GO. THE TASTE OF SLIM JIMS IS A MIX OF PEPPORNI AND AND BEFF JERKY BECAUSE THATS WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE. THIS IS A GREAT SNACK AND YOU SHOULD GET THEM."
2827,WOW is all I can say. My dreams have come true with my Cherry Tomato kit for indoor tomato's just growing crazy and most of all it is fun to see them progress.<br /><br />Once they end and are spent I plan on replacing them again with the Cherry Tomato Kit as nothing is like a cherry tomato right off the vine!<br /><br />Happy as all can be ;)
2828,"I won't order these again.  I was pleased to be ordering something that said ""sustainable agriculture"", but these are not good.  Half the cans are dented.  I'm afraid to eat these unless they are cooked, so cannot use them in salads.  They are not quartered, as near as I can tell, but are in tiny bits, lots of tough outer leaves and all the cans I've used so far are full of extremely mushy, teeny artichoke pieces.  I wish I had even one good thing to say, but I don't.  I've throw out over half of every can I've tried to use so far."

Unless your child is lactose intolerant, consider using Similac Advance or another formula that is made primarily with **milk**.

2830,Another sugar-free low-carb product that is an excellent replacement food for those on restricted diets as well as those who wish to eat a healthy product that is just as delicious as other pancake mixes.  These pancakes come out light and fluffy and are delicious by themselves or with low-carb maple toppings with berries.  I add pecans to the mix and they are absoulutely wonderful.  Give them a try.

2831,"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product."
2832,"WARNING WARNING!!!!  This is DOG Food,  I fed my precious cat 10 cans of this, (he was not fond of it) before I realized it says DOG Food on the label in such tiny print!!!<br />I have used Weruva products before that my cats love, especially the Asian fish but Amazon was back ordered so I ordered this because Amazon says it is cat food --WRONG.  Buyer Beware!!  I don't own a dog so I guess the neighbor's dog will  enjoy some expensive food."

2836,"I ordered this specifically for a recipe for Chi Chi's seafood enchiladas/Cancun on Recipe Zaar. The recipe consistently got five stars rating. It called for a tablespoon of lobster base (for a half recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, adding no salt and using no salt butter.  The dish was so salty that we threw it out.  Later, while trying to figure out what went wrong I found that this particular lobster base has 800 mg of sodium per tsp.  So, I had used 2400 mg of sodium in a recipe for 4-6 enchiladas.  We like salt--too much sometimes--but this was beyond the pale!!  Now, I've got 2 jars of this base and doubt I'll ever use it.  What a disappointment! Just be careful!"

2838,"This cheese is not good.  I do not know how to more clearly state it.  It is a strange brown color and comes in an unnatural square shape.  It seems ""manufactured"" and tastes like no cheese should taste.  Slicing it thin is no help.  It has a strange butterscotch-y flavor, but is not as sweet and the consistency is just icky.  Bad, bad, bad stuff.  Nearly as bad as Velveeta.  Maybe even worse."

2843,"I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use."
2844,"Xyloburst Peppermint Gum, 100 count<br />Made in USA with materials from China (Non GMO)<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural Flavors (peppermint oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Gum Arabic, Soy Lecithin, Beeswax<br /><br />This was my first time trying xylitol gum and it was pretty good.  Very intense at first and then fades, but not too quickly.  The flavor does last awhile considering it's a more natural gum.  I was debating between this and Spry gum, but a lot of reviewers said that Spry faded quickly.  Glad I chose this instead.  The pieces look big in the container (each is 1.5grams), but they chew down small so you might want to chew 2 at a time.  Amazon also has a 500 count container, which is a better value if you can afford paying it at once.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NE02K"">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 500 Count</a>  This also comes in blister packs (total of 144 pieces) and sometimes it's cheaper than the 100 count container <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019AC50I"">Xyloburst Peppermint Blister Pack 12 12 Pc Packages</a>.

This one, with its dual French/English labeling and Free Range title, appeared to be a North American free-range organic-type natural product. Especially given the price. But it is NOT, it is also made in China. Upon closer inspection it says this product has no ADDED hormones, antibiotics, preservatives... but it doesnt say the product is FREE OF these additives. I feel duped, and I am returning.  I can get the same China-quality for half the price without being taken for a ride."
2846,"I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE"">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market."

2849,"*****<br />This Fasting Tea from Yogi Tea for Weight Loss Support is ""designed to promote healthy functioning of the stomach and intestines, and to help you feel more energetic while you lose weight."" Fasting Tea is based on an Ayurvedic formula---Ayurveda is an Indian form of health care now also becoming popular in the United States.<br /><br />It's suggested that you drink Fasting Tea 15 minutes before eating. I have done this, and it does really seem to help, although I'm not quite sure if the effect is physiological or psychological. Oh, well, I don't care, since it helps me to be in control of my eating. It has a sweet and pleasing taste, and is quite enjoyable to sip on while others are filling up on bread, appetizers, and high-calorie drinks and alcohol.<br /><br />I am impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Fasting Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Fasting is made with organic Red Clover and Garcinia Fruit designed to help support a healthy weight loss program, as it aids digestive functions, supports the metabolism and encourages internal cleansing. The tea includes hydroxy-citric acid that is found in the Garcinia Fruit, native to Southeast Asia. This naturally occurring substance has been shown to simultaneously suppress the appetite, help reduce fats and cholesterol in the liver and disrupt the process by which the body stores excess calories as fat. We have also included the warming herbs Fennel Seed, Cinnamon Bark and Black Pepper to help promote circulation, as well as Red Clover, which works as a tonic and a blood purifier. The recipe is complimented with Alfalfa Leaf, Indian Bacopa Leaf (Gotu Kola), and English Hawthorn Berry, all of which can aid the body in the elimination of wastes that are known to slow the metabolism. Finally, we've included Burdock, Dandelion and Yellow Dock Roots, all used by European herbalists for centuries to support the liver in eliminating toxins."" Other ingredients in this tea are Licorice Root, Alfalfa Leaf, Cardamom Seed, Ginger Root, Clove Bud, Barley Malt, Date Powder, Natural Plum Flavor, and Natural Passion Fruit Flavor. Almost every ingredient in this tea is also organic.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Fasting Tea contains no caffeine whatsoever. It steeps for 5-10 minutes, a nice long time, but I find that I only need one tea bag instead of two for a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />I really like this tea, and it is very health-promoting.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br />*****"
2850,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea.""  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea.""  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original."
2851,"I am new to matcha drinking, so was somewhat concerned re: customer comments Culinary Teas matcha being ""brown"" (i.e. a not the correct bright green color). I had only tried Starbucks Matcha (PLEASE BE ADVISED - it is very tasty, but probably because the number one ingredient on the label is sugar). Also, a pound of Starbucks Matcha (as sold on a popular auction site) costs about the same as a pound of Culinary Teas bulk Matcha)...so you are getting far less of the expensive and healthful green tea powder and more sugar (the Starbucks product is somehow micronized so it does mix into solution much easier than a less processed pure tea powder). The teaspoon on the right is Teavana (at $16 for 30 grams - thats 2 Tbsp) they said it was the highest ""tea ceremony"" quality matcha. The teaspoon on the left is the bulk (1 lb, silver bag) CT product. Photo taken without a flash and not retouched so actual colors show. CT matcha  is slightly less brilliant green. I mixed exact quantities (1/2 tsp) of matcha in 8 oz of liquid with exact quantities of sweetener (a blend of xylitol and stevia that I am experimenting with). The CT matcha tastes slightly less ""green"" and slightly more bitter than the Teavana, but I did the math ( a pound of CT would cost $240 at the Teavana $16 per 30 g cost) - so I am very happy with my CT purchase. Will use the smaller container for my ""working"" supply, freeze the rest and use as needed. Am finding Matcha to be a great substitute for my ""too much coffee"" habit and prefer the less instantaneous (but prolonged) energy boost it gives - not too mention alkalizing instead of acidifying, ECGC, and possible metabolism boosting effect.<br />PS Most Starbucks barristas do not know the Matcha powder contains sugar, so they will tell you the are not adding any. As consumers, we need to ask companies to STOP ADDING SUGAR (in whatever processed form it takes) to everything they make."
2852,"I just bought 2 bags of the product. Tried and it was all PRO's until I noticed the big CON: one of the ingredients is corn syrup! I usually eat all organic food and love healthy stuff - I'm sooooo against corn syrup. I could've avoided the surprise, though, by reading the ingredient list that was disclosed in the product's page at amazon.com.<br />Well, as I said before, there are good things about the product, too. The chocolate bit is really creamy as they say, and deliciously bittersweet. It tastes so fresh and helped boosting my energy. Oh, and the delivery was really fast - I had it in two days!<br />Please, please, make them without corn syrup so that I can give it 5 stars :) !!"
2853,"Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky."
2854,"People who take candy seriously are a vulnerable group.  So why name a straightforward candy ""nerds""?  It seems like you are poking fun at your supporters.  Especially for the sour ones (which are I think the best), the conventional thing would be to call them something like ""McGillicutty's"" and have a picture of a scowling Irishman.  The candy itself is just going to be sugar, corn syrup, stabilizers and some flavoring--the name is what gives you a sense of what it is.<br /><br />In general, the Wonka lines have been a depressing experience.  First, no one should have been so cynical as to use the name ""Willy Wonka"" for real candy.  It's like Fruit of the Loom having ""Thomas Jefferson"" briefs.  And I'll get back to that.  But second, the candy has consistently been uninventive, third rate, and with no particular appeal.  All it does is drag W.W.'s image into the ground as opposed to it being an inspiration.<br /><br />And as we all know, Wonka is now actually a part of Nestle's.  Now as someone previously in the candy business, I have to say that Nestle's main-line and high-quality line products in the candy/chocolate world are pretty good.  But as a company, Nestle is a nightmare--poisoning pets, starving babies.  If Nestle owned the real Willy Wonka factory, the Oompa-Loompas would turn out to be slaves.  I just can't understand a world in which Nestle owns the right to put out low grade candy and call it Willy Wonka.<br /><br />Willy Wonka represented the dream of doing good, being a child, and being honest.  That was why Charlie got the factory--because he precisely wasn't the kind of guy who would go far in Nestle's.  I feel like in this product, Nestle is basically saying to Charlie, ""you're a nerd!  Maybe you can work in the tech department programming the payroll computers!  But you sure as heck can't run the factory and we're not interested in any of your spacey ideas!""<br /><br />And one last thing--if you're my age, you've probably had to listen, more than you wanted to, to the song ""Nurds"" (the spelling was ""charmingly"" wrong) by the Roches.  Now if there's one thing you don't want associated with your candy product, it's roaches.  Animal contamination is always a real threat, and it's often not taken seriously enough.  So, Nestle, when you were done with your ethically-dubious activities in the third world, you somehow chose a name for a candy that would both spit in the face of Charlie Bucket and make the consumer queasy.  Who's running this show? [15]"
2855,"Green tea may be a valuable part of the diet for many people, however, consuming green tea is either a knowing or unknowing choice of suicide by those of us who need blood thinners. Because of its vitamin k content, it reduces or eliminates the affect of blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavis and even low dose aspirin. Vitamin K, present in extremely high quantities in green tea, promotes coagulation and consequently the formation of clots. Clots kill through stroke and heart attack.<br /><br />If you have either been prescribed blood thinners of any type or a family history of vascular problems, green tea should be regarded as a powerful and potentially deadly poison."
2856,"I took a shot based on the great ""subscribe and save"" pricing for these.  Haven't tried them in my brewer yet, but a few initial impressions ""as received"":<br /><br />1. These are not k-cups in the traditional sense.  There's no ""cup"" to them, just the filter attached to a rim with a seal on it.  So I don't see how these could possibly ""brew"" in the cup like a k-cup is supposed to brew.  I'm betting these are another ""instant"" coffee designed to fit a Keurig brewer.<br />2. The shipment of 3 packages of 12 each that I received was 3 clear plastic bags.  No box as shown on the listing picture.  Now I get it they say packing may differ from that depicted, but IMHO it's dishonest of Amazon to display these online with a box when they know they aren't going to ship them that way.<br />3. Combining #1 and #2 together means once you open the plastic bag of 12, since the individual servings aren't sealed per se, in order to keep them fresh it seems to me you would need to put them in some sort of sealed container.  Not at all user friendly for the many ""carousel"" and ""drawer"" k-cup storage units offered.<br /><br />I do not plan to open and try them at all.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/10/2012: As you can see from above, I wasn't particularly happy with what I received.  But as I said, those were my ""initial impressions"" and I believe fairly stated for what they are.  That said, I did contact Amazon customer service about my displeasure, and they issued a full credit to my account.  I've been buying from Amazon since 1998, and this is probably only the 4th or 5th time I've requested a refund on a purchase.  Since this is a grocery item, Amazon said they could not accept a return even IF unopened, and the customer service rep encouraged me to keep the coffee and go ahead and try it.  So, I did.<br />I'm happy to report that it is INDEED real coffee (not instant), the aroma is great and the taste is great.  I've upped my rating from 2 to 4 stars.  I do feel justified in knocking the score 1 star for the inadequate description as people need to understand these are NOT ""K-cups"", but they ARE real coffee packaged in a manner different than most would expect when buying coffee for their Keurig. And I still contend that displaying what looks like a nice retail box in the item photo is also misleading.<br />My issue #3 of course remains unresolved, and also contributes to the lower of my rating.  You need to keep these stored in a decanter or some other sealed container if you want to keep the other 11 fresh after you open the plastic bag to brew up your first cup."
2857,"I've been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date.<br /><br />The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the ""lightly sweetened"" remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you'll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong (""lightly sweetened"" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight."
2858,"Best cinnamon I have found and used in over 45 years of Baking.<br />I am a repeat customer for this Frontier Cinnamon Powder (Korintje / A Grade (3% oil).<br />On my first order, I found reviews stating the 3% Oil  was a much stronger flavor and aroma than normal cinnamon (Such as McCormick's), and others just CAN""T COMPARE. AND that the Korintje cinnamon was equivalent to cinnamon so popular from CINNABUNS.<br />I have won several ribbons for my baking, and have had some of my receipes published. I now have reqular orders and some special orders from customers that consider my Carrot Cake among the best. I give some of that credit to the use of this cinnamon in my carrot CAKE receipe, and my husband ""RAVES"" for my STICKY BUNS with pecans. I first considered and tried using less of the cinnamon, than originally called for in my receipes. (And that works well, and makes for less cost for the receipe). But I have found (including suggestion from my husband) that using the same amount as originally called for in the recipes, just ADDS to the flavor and robust aroma of the baked goods."
2859,"This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old ""My K-cup"" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says ""some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this ""work around"" for the time being.""  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more ""hole down the middle"" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!"

2861,"I often drink vitamin and oxygen enhanced water so I thought I'd try this water due to the trace minerals.  This was difficult for me to drink, the flavor is not water like and while it doesn't taste dirty or gritty, it's a mental thing. The water is very very black almost like a strong dark coffee.  I'd strongly suggest trying a single serving before buying an entire case because out of 4 people in my family no one really liked it,...that leaves 20 bottles."
2862,"I purchased this product out of curiosity -- to see if it would work differently (or as well) in my homemade yogurt than the instant powdered milk. And oh, yes, there's a big, big difference -- in taste and consistency (in the liquid milk *and* the yogurt). Based on the cost of instant dry milk around here (GA), it's quite a bit less expensive too -- you use less of it to make a quart than with instant.<br /><br />While I've heard that this form of milk is harder to mix, I didn't find it that much different from reconstituting the instant version, except that I needed to use warm water instead of cold. I did have a first trial that gave, ahem, unexpected results. ((YMMV, of course -- but if you end up needing to use a whisk, and plan to use the milk for yogurt, you might get an interesting ""bubble effect"" texture in the finished product. :))<br /><br />On my next experiment, also with warm water (just under 120 degrees), a few rounds of patient (slow) spoon-stirring was all it seemed to take -- I just waited a minute in between stirings. In each case, adding the nearly-room-temperature starter-yogurt made the temperature just right for the yogurt-maker. (If you use warm water and plan to use the milk for drinking, you'll want to refrigerate until chilled -- in other words, plan ahead.)<br /><br />So again, the mixing process is a little different, but not that much different -- and the results are very much worth the little bit of extra care. To me, the chilled liquid tastes as good as regular milk from the store -- I didn't think I'd ever say that about powdered milk!<br /><br />Just a couple of downsides to mention, though they're minor:<br /><br />- I wish there were mixing directions on the package -- how much powder to use to how much water. But I eventually found ballpark directions on the Internet. I used about a cup of powder and a bit over 3 cups of water to make a quart of yogurt, but it turned out so thick, I'll probably try a little less next time.<br /><br />- While the product packaging doesn't say this, I suspect this form of milk is the kind without the added Vitamins A & D that most store milks have. I get plenty of these vitamins from other sources, so it's not a deal breaker for me. It might be for you."
2863,"I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.<br /><br />The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.<br /><br />A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises."

2867,"Ghirardelli doesn't include ""chocolate"" in this white sauce's name for a reason:<br /><br />Unlike white chocolate which consists of cocoa butter, condensed milk, and sugar, Ghirardelli ""Classic White Flavored Sauce"" consists of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, food starch, and carrageenan (which makes the sauce thick and creamy). The sauce contains no cocoa butter, and its unspecified dairy flavors are way down the list of ingredients.<br /><br />in short, this sauce gives my coffee drinks, hot chocolate, and desserts a sweet and creamy consistency with a flavor similar to vanilla or, more accurately, doughnut or pastry frosting.<br /><br />The good news: Unlike real white chocolate, this is fat-free, it's marginally lower in calories, and it pours easily.<br /><br />For a more authentic white-chocolate sauce -- including the saturated fat and additional calories -- try Fontana White Chocolate Mocha Sauce. It contains all the key ingredients of real white chocolate; it's Starbucks' choice for the coffee chain's white-chocolate drinks; and (contrary to the sauce's name) it does NOT contain ""mocha"" (coffee).<br /><br />If you buy Ghirardelli's sauce in the 64-ounce bottle, be sure to pay less than $20 for it.

2871,"Pros: My dogs love them. They last a long time. They don't really stink after the first 30 seconds.<br /><br />Cons: They're a little pricey.  And I don't like to think about what they're made out of.  They lose the star on price, though.  Pound for pound, they cost more than dry-aged USDA Prime Rib.  I don't buy USDA Dry-Aged Prime Rib for myself, so I'm not sure how I got talked into paying that kind of money for a dog treat.  I blame my wife.  She says I'm stingy with the dogs.  I say I'm pragmatic and our dogs would be happy eating out of the litterbox if we would let them.<br /><br />My dogs will recite Shakespearean sonnets for these treats.  One of them has learned how to mow the lawn for me, and the other has started grading my students' homework in exchange for a half-length of one of these apparently delectable sections of dried out taurine...parts.  (Seriously, don't look up what they're made out of if you're squeamish.)<br /><br />These things are expensive compared to regular rawhide, but they do provide a longer chewtime-per-inch for my mutts and, so I've been told by professionals, don't have the same potential to cause gastrointestinal damage.  Furthermore, I cannot emphasize enough how much my dogs prefer these things to regular rawhide chews.  They just have to see me move my hand toward the bag and all of a sudden my two Tasmanian devils are stone-still statues of obedience eagerly awaiting, nay, eagerly DESIRING any word of command I might give.  Therefore, despite the price, I don't feel I've gotten the shaft on this deal.  At least not metaphorically.  Euphemistically, though, I suppose I got a whole bag of them.<br /><br />Oops, sorry.  Now you know what they're made out of.<br /><br />When you first open the bag, they'll smell bad.  After 30 seconds, there is no scent whatsoever unless you wave one of them right under your nose.  If you're the kind of person who regularly waves dried out steer phallus under your nose and you need them to be totally odor-free, get a different product.<br /><br />You'll need some heavy-duty garden shears or a really sharp cleaver if you're going to cut the foot-longs down to smaller sizes.  This process makes me wince in some sort of primal, Y-chromosome encoded empathic reaction, even though I realize the animal from which the product was taken no longer has need of it.  My wife says I'm a wuss.  I say I'm compassionate.<br /><br />If you have neither a prohibitively strong gender-based moral qualm regarding the raw materials used to make a bully stick nor a hyper-developed sense of smell, and you can afford to pay Dry-aged USDA Prime Rib prices to throw pieces of dessicated steer pizzle to an animal that will wolf down filet mignon with the same delight it takes in bolting cat poop when you're not watching, then go ahead and buy these.  At least your dogs will give you their undivided attention for the 15 seconds between your opening the bag and distributing the treat."
2872,This is absolutely the BEST DECAF coffee I have ever had. The flavor is outstanding and does not lose aroma or taste as most decaf's do.  If you are like me and cannot drink regular coffee this is the one for you.

However, the primary ingredient of this ""seasoning"" is nothing but MSG.  Then it has pepper.  Then some more MSG.  Then maybe a few specks of some type of powder, which I presume is some derivative of MSG.  Then it has one flake of oregano.  Then it has MSG.  Then it has one speck of parsley flakes.  Then it claims to have onion powder, but I think it's just more MSG.  Finally, it has MSG-powder, MSG-salt and MSG-flakes.  Perfect stuff for your next MSG-induced nightmare headache, the likes of which you've never known.  Other than that, you'll probably like this stuff.<br /><br />Edited to respond to the lone critic who claims this does NOT have MSG...an individual I can only surmise is a shareholder or employee of Goya...so, here's the ingredient list for you people, since he, while claiming it has no MSG (not true), failed to provide it himself:<br /><br />Ingredients: Salt, Granulated Garlic, Tricalcium Phosphate (prevents caking), Monosodium Glutamate, Oregano, Black Pepper, Tumeric, Onion Powder, Spices.<br /><br />Note that ""spices"" can also be termed to include MSG as well, but here they go the extra measure and at least spell it out for you...something this other reviewer must have missed or be unable to read.<br /><br />So, there you have it.

2874,"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?"
2875,"Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China...

2876,I was ready to buy these seeds and I figured I would see what Nutiva actually charges.  $54.99!  BUT the packaging is different.  Why does Amazon sell the same product with different labelling?

2878,"I'm not English but my mother was so I grew up a confirmed tea drinker. The British often complain that they can't get a decent cuppa in this country. Sadly true!<br /><br />I spent most of my adult life looking for a tea company that would make the strong steaming cuppa that makes everything better. If you like a good black tea, THIS is the one. I tried Yorkshire Tea for a few years and then discovered Yorkshire Gold and there was no turning back! Even my staunchly American husband wants this tea each day. This is a tea that has substance and an excellent taste. I bought the 160-ct tea bags because I don't want to risk running out, especially now that my husband is demanding a cup of this excellent tea daily. Somtimes he wants it at bedtime to soothe his soul as he does his paperwork after I've gone to bed.<br /><br />I tried PG Tips, Red Rose, and other prominent English brands but although they were a distinct improvement over Tetley and Lipton teas (gag!), they are no match for Yorkshire Gold. I have found MY tea. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Come to think of it, I believe it's time for a steaming cuppa on this rainy day! Cheers!"

2881,"Does not work as advertised.<br /><br />When I input into my centrifuges, it just made a mess instead of depleted uranium ore that I could turn into plutonium.  Very inconvenient for a man who is looking to have delusions of grandeur.<br /><br />However, when baked in an oven, it makes a delicious treat.  I recommend combining the oven-baked product with a product known as ""icing"".  No, ""icing"" does not cause anything to freeze."
2882,"This Hostess Chocolate Pudding Pie literally has a laundry-list of bad and even worse ingredients  and reads like a chemistry problem. Let's start with enriched wheat flour, vegetable(s) oil shortening - including partially hydrogenated oil(s), corn syrup, plus high fructose corn syrup, plus-plus more sweetener as sugar, modified corn starch, soy protein isolate, even more vegetable(s) oils as partially hydrogenated, beef fat. Now blend in some titanium dioxide, artificial flavors and food colors yellow 5 and red 40. Do you really want this ""food"" around for your kids to eat? Not recommended in my world."
2883,"I first had the Big Franks while visiting a friend during high school and I've loved them ever since. They do not taste exactly like traditional meat hotdogs and the closest description of the flavor that I can come up with is something like a light-flavored vienna sausage. Otherwise, you can use the same condiments as regular hotdogs, or add mayo to add a bit more of a creamy flavor to them."
2884,"I love this oil, good flavor, love that it's organic, BUT the pour spout makes such a mess on the top of the tin that you have to wipe up & waste (1/2 teaspoon with every single pour) and sometimes even runs down the side of the tin that I won't be buying it again unless the tin is designed better.  I've tried pouring fast, slow, etc. and it just doesn't pour well at all."
2885,"I bought the four-pack of this cereal from Amazon, and absolutely love it! Being a single guy, it is really simple and fast to make (just pop a large bowl in the microwave!) and very hearty. As with any plain-old grain cereal, the base is pretty bland (though, it can be eaten that way ... it's not as flavorless as some!), but is easy to work with ... add a small touch of blueberry syrup and a few fresh blueberries, or a touch of brown sugar and some maple syrup, and it's truly delightful! I will definitely buy another box when this one runs out."
2886,"I am interested in buying this for personal use.  There is no description at all about what I am buying other than it's Vintage brand seltzer.  What is 28 pounds?  Is it 1 pound of product and 27 pounds of container?  27.9 pounds of seltzer and .1 pounds of container?  How much is a pound of seltzer anyway? Are all 28 pounds in one container,  16 ounce bottles, 1 oz. bottles, one pound bottles?<br /><br />I can't imagine they're moving too much of this product through this ad."
2887,"I put this kit together tonight with my two young sons and we had a ball. (We paid $10 for it at Fred Meyer, which was $5 off their normal price, so beware that the cost on this site is ridiculously high). The pieces were easy to assemble and the tray that comes with the kit is handy (beats having to find some cardboard to cover with tin foil. My only complaint is the frosting because it got overly gooey before we could finish our assembly and it wasn't tough enough to hold some of the heavier candy. I kept putting it in the fridge to firm it up a little. I'd also recommend cutting the tip of the frosting at less than the 1/4"" that the instructions recommend. I'd say 1/8th"" would have been better. Overall, I was impressed with the finished product. It was easy to clean up the mess, there was plenty of candy and some to spare, and the kids had a blast. I bought a similar kit in the shape of a train and we look forward to putting that one together as well."
2888,"I love this cereal and I eat it regularly, but at $20 for 4 boxes, you're paying $5 a box, which is outrageous. You can find it in stores for $2 a box, which means that you're paying a 150% markup.<br /><br />In short: great cereal, terrible price."
2889,"My cat is a rescued feral who has some gum and intestinal issues left over from his humble beginnings.  He loves the taste of these treats.  Unlike many kinds of cat food and treats, the Greenies do not give him gas or diarrhea.  And his mouth and coat (he is is a meticulous groomer) smell less like a dumpster.  Good for him.  Good for us."
2890,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys."
2891,"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee."

2893,"We find it keeps our dogs teeth clean, breath fresh and she loves them. We found that the Petite Chews are the same product as the Regular.  Only difference between the two is the Petite are half the length.  Per OZ the Regular size cost less so you can just break them in half if you want a shorter size."
2894,"My 80 year old Mom suffered from excruciating back and muscle pain. When I took her to see an MD specializing in pain relief, he recommended she try using CALM first, stating many of his patients found significant pain relief by addressing their magnesium deficiency by taking CALM. After she successfully reduced the pain using CALM as part of the regimen prescribed by her MD, my husband and I started using CALM for our muscle and joint pains, (61 and 58) and also found relief from pain; we accidently discovered it promotes a good night's sleep when we missed taking it one night and did not sleep as well. All of us now use CALM daily and stockpile a 3 month supply!"
2895,"we love sodastream soda maker but not its syrups.  my bf is a soda addict, drink soda like water, who sneaks out to a deli, which is at least 15 mins away as the closest ones closed at midnight, for a 2 Liter bottle of cherry coke at 3am in the morning. i bought the sodastream jet starter kit and this sodamix variety pack for him as i don't want to buy bottles of sodas from supermarket, carrying them walking at least 2 flights of stairs, separating the trash for recycle and dragging bags of empty bottles out which he promised he will help but rarely does. i bought sodastream totally because i m lazy but not being eco-friendly at all. the 1st day we received them, he made 4 different flavors and made me to finish them all with him that night. he loves to play with the loud buzz button and constantly needs new bottle for another flavor as the starter kit comes with only 1 bpa free bottle.  i never like anything fizzy while he likes it bubbles until his blood fizz like the soda. we tried #1.fountain mist #2.orange #3. lemon-lime #4.diet cola respectively. he hates anything ""diet"" and complained even the non diet syrups taste like diet. the last one he tested from the variety pack was the diet cola as it doesn't come with the regular cola which he craved. i said the diet cola taste like the regular cola n yuck. he agreed with the yuck but blah blah blah about the taste different between the regular coka cola coke n this sodamix diet cola syrup.  he believed that the sodamix regular cola syrup must be better than the diet one and planned to get it the next day. suddenly he screamed out ""splen-daaaaa"" in a weird accent while he was reading the ingredients/ nutrition facts. he lost interests in this variety pack and tried to fizz everything drinkable in the fridge: #5. welch's white grape cherry juice just by itself without water, it exploded while the bottle is still intact to the machine, mess everywhere, he said ""errrk"". #6. water+ribena, considering carbonating the juice creates messes, we just carbonated the water and substitute the syrup with something else, with the same amount of the individually packaged syrup from the variety pack, ribena isnt as concentrated, i continued added more ribena but still taste bland and ended up ran out of ribena. #7. we bought the sodamix regular cola from BB&B the today, while pouring the syrup in after carbonating the water, it just splashed all over the counter top and the kitchen floor. better pour it inside the sink.  he said it tastes better than the diet syrup but still has a slightly aspartame/weird sugar after taste, not as good as the regular coca cola. #8. carbonated water+OJ: 1/4 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ = taste is ok, less strong, not fizzy. 1/2 cup of carbonated water + 3/4 cup of no pulp OJ: not fizzy and taste only with a tint of OJ. 1 cup of carbonated water + 1 cup of no pulp OJ, fizzy but bland.  We bought the sodamix cherry cola syrup, but we r full from drinking carbonated sugared liquid these 2 days. we will try it and update tomorrow."
2896,"Hi, first time reviewer here. Not because i never have an opinion, its just that i've never fully been moved to take time out of my day to give my two cents about something that someone is just going to read, ignore and go find out their own opinion anyway. But this seaweed snack that everyone is raving about is by far, bar none the nastiest bucket of yuck i have ever tasted in my entire life! it tastes like fermented ocean A**. Again i feel compelled to tell you the truth about this sea-garbage because every other review here is obviously someone who works for trader joe's and just trying to pitch the new product that they cant move off their shelves because there are no return customers. this seaweed snack has completely ruined my day and if it weren't for this beer in my hand to rid my tongue and nose of these rotting aromatics id probably take my own life just so that it would end. thank you for your time, and never buy this s***."
2897,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!"
2898,"Searching the internet may tell you that malt flour is sometimes called malt powder.  This may lead you to believe that this is a malt powder, such as you might use for making beer or a killer malted milkshake.  Although this product is visually indistinguishable from such malt powder, it tastes like flour, and cannot be used for these purposes unless you like four in your milkshake.  It does make for really good pancakes, as long as you don't add too much.  I would go no more than 1/4 malt flour to 3/4 regular flour, and possibly less."

For some reason I assumed Greenies were natural and it's completely my fault for not looking for the ingredients on another site before buying, but yeah... these are corn-based and thus not very different from the junk you can get in the supermarket.  Oh, except these cost more.  So why should I buy them??

That being said, my boys will not hesitate to eat them if they do get dried out from leaving them in the bait bag.  At the 4-for-3 promotion price, you can't go wrong!"
2904,"Earlier this year, the FDA enacted a new rule forcing companies to take the gluten-free label from anything that has more than 20 ppm gluten.  (I'm looking at you, Arrowhead Mills and Bob's Red Mill.)<br /><br />However, you can be right at 20 ppm, which makes a lot of celiacs sick, and still label yourself, ""gluten free"".  (The rule should have said, ""less than 20 ppm"", not ""20 ppm or less"".)<br /><br />This is where Amazon is fantastic--they made the company list the gluten in this, so we know it's NOT gluten free.  (I have yet to find a Hain's food product that was actually gluten free, although some of them are legally gluten free.  Look for their name on the labels so you know what to avoid, even if they are hiding behind the federal law and they have labeled their products gf.)<br /><br />Pacific Rice Milk and Whole Foods' store brands of rice milk are gluten free, though.  Buy those instead."

2907,"Well, I have five of these gardens now, so obviously this is a product I've been very happy with.  I started out with tomatoes and salad greens, and the salad greens were so tasty I added a second garden of those and two strawberry gardens (the second one is on order).<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pumps or noise, and everything has grown beautifully.  With five gardens going at once, it's so bright in that area of my kitchen that it looks like a UFO landing site, LOL, but they are all scheduled to go off at 11 p.m. so it's no problem at night when we're sleeping.<br /><br />These gardens are so cheerful to have around.  They add a nice moisture and a green, fresh smell, and I find the lights cheerful too.<br /><br />The salad greens grow very quickly and are so tasty that my biggest problem is resisting the urge to constantly pluck off leaves and eat them all day long.  That's why I got a second one -- so there would be plenty.  With four in my family, one garden did not produce quite enough for us.  Our first salad crop also did not grow for very long, only a couple of months, but I think that's just the nature of the plant.  The tomatoes took a long time to go to the fruiting stage (13 weeks), but now they are producing two or three ripe tomatoes each day, and they are delicious.<br /><br />I love having food growing indoors.  No bugs, no bird poop, no dirt, and everything can be eaten right off the plant.  Tonight over dinner we literally watched our first strawberry turn from white to pink on the end.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly economical way to grow food, but it's loads of fun and has been educational and exciting for my kids, who are much more interested in fresh produce than they used to be.<br /><br />I've had no trouble with either the pumps or the customer service.  In fact, everyone at Aerogrow has been very kind and helpful, both over the phone and in e-mail.  I hope the company continues to thrive because I just love these little gardens and hope to use them for years."
2908,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.

2909,"When you go through K-cups like I do, this large quantity purchase is perfect.  Hazelnut is always a favorite and this particular brand holds up to a generous cup serving.  Some brands get too watered down in a large mug, but this has body enough to take it.  Since I store my K-cups in a drawer, it doesn't matter that the shipping box is a bare bones container.  I just appreciate the value.  All in all, it's a great way to buy K-cups in quantity.  Highly recommended."
2910,"Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are incredible. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of ""steel cut"" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of Chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite. I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days. One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles. But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon! Could the chia seeds have helped? I think so. I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when ""on"" the chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Navitas Naturals Chia Seeds, but have since started buying it on Amazon for a fraction of the price. Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible."
2911,"Silly me - I thought 60 containers meant 15 of each of the four types of cereal.  Instead, I got 22 of the plain Special K (my least favorite of the four) and only 4 of the Kashi (the one I really wanted).  I'll eat them because I paid for them and they are convenient but I won't buy this ""assortment"" again.<br /><br />Unless you're a big fan of Special K, don't bother."
2912,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables.

2913,"For health reasons, I try to eat highly nutritious low carb foods. I love tapioca but it's 100% carbs with no nutritional value. I was introduced to chia seeds and it is a highly nutritious low carb food but it is also a fun food. It absorbs 12x its weight in liquids and puffs up and reminds me of tapioca with a strawberry seed inside (and that's what it tastes/feels like). Another one of my favorites is the Mexican drink called: Chia fresca, which is basically soaked chia seeds in lemonade. You have to experience it yourself to know why it's so popular.  One lb. added to liquid will create 10-14# of highly nutritious food.<br /><br />Chia seeds (best known for the chia pet) are high in protein, 5x the calcium of milk and high in Omega 3 oils. Chia seeds are seeds of an herb and are grown in Mexico, south & central America and were the food of the Aztecs.<br /><br />I would think you could make faux tapioca pudding with just coconut milk, chia seeds & sweetener, but I don't know how well the chia would absorb the coconut milk since it's so fatty. (Can of coconut milk, 1/4 cup chia seeds & sweetener to taste) I make it with 2 cups of water, 4 scoops of whey protein, then I soak one cup of chia seeds in this and when it has plumped up, I add 2 cans of coconut milk and sweetener. Sometimes I cream a package of cream cheese into a can of pumpkin, cinnamon and add that for more nutrition for a pumpkin pie tapioca pudding."
2914,"I purchased this product because I wanted a powdered full fat cream substitute for baking and cooking on my low carb diet  ( full fat cream has zero carbs). However, when the product arrived, it was DRY WHOLE MILK which has 8 grams of carbs per 3 tbsp!  It has a decent taste and arrived as promised, but I would have never purchased dry whole milk... The product title is misleading....."
2915,"I went on Amazon looking for some type of dog chew or hard food that would take a long time for my dog to get through, but not so hard that she would give up.  She's about 25 pounds, active, but won't play with any toys, and can get down a rawhide in ten minutes.  I wanted to find something to cut into her boredom and downtime, but not add a lot of calories.<br /><br />The first day I put it together (took about one minute) and rolled it across the floor.  She slowly took after it, investigated, and I went to make dinner.  I enjoyed my first dinner at home in about a year that didn't involve my dog staring at me hoping for a handout.  She just obsessed over the ball, licking it, and grinding at it with her teeth.  After dinner I checked it, and she had made what appeared to be almost negligible progress on the treat.  We watched a movie in peace (other than this constant weird panting/slurping noise from the other room).  At some point, we realized she had been working on this thing for about three hours.  My wife checked her mouth, she was afraid her gums would be bleeding or that her teeth would be ground down to the gums.  But no sign of damage.  We took it away from her and put it on top of the fridge, and she sat there staring up at the fridge for about half an hour.<br /><br />I'm now on my third day, about three hours a day, still working on the first two discs that fit on opposite sides of the ball.  I think maybe she's gotten through about half of it.  She's actually penetrated one of the discs with a hole that goes all the way through.  She's obsessed.  While she has it, she doesn't want to do anything else.  If I go to pet her (which she normally loves) she treats me as an irritant keeping her from her ball.  Want to walk (normally her favorite thing)?  Nope.  Maybe after I'm done with this ball in another 16 hours I'll walk.  I wonder how long she would be on this ball if I let her?  Her jaws must be cramping up.  I get the feeling I could give it to her, go to bed, and wake up to see her with bloodshot eyes still working on the ball.  It's like crystal meth for dogs.<br /><br />Oh my god, while I'm writing this my dog accidentally rolled the ball under a table and she can't get to it.  She looks like an alcoholic staring at a drink they can't reach.  I actually feel sorry for her.  It's almost 9pm and she's been on this thing since 6pm.<br /><br />Anyway, for my dog, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I give it 5 stars."
2916,"This is the second time I've ordered this coconut flour. It's great to bake with. This is my favorite recipe to make with it. I have also used this basic recipe and leave out the chocolate and make a raspberry zinger like cake by spreading sugar free raspberry jam on top of the cake batter and sprinkling unsweetened coconut flakes on top before baking. I buy most of my baking supplies at Netrition because it's cheaper and only costs four ninety five for shipping no matter how much you buy. Here's the recipe for the coconut cake.

2917,"The charming picture on the box was reminiscent of the more special momments in your childhood. Unfortunately, the crude sludge contained within was not as enjoyable. With an odor which served only to offend my delicate nasal passages, slightly akin to that of burning vaseline. The taste was generally harsh, and burned my palate. A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink. Avoid.<br /><br /> -My cat on the other hand loves the stuff."
2918,"I know instant noodles aren't considered to be a health food, but I can't see any reason for some of the ingredients in this soup, unless it's to hide other poor quality ingredients.  Most of the ingredients are chemical sounding names that I had never heard of, so I looked them up.  Among them, propylene Glycol is a colourless viscous hydroscopic sweet-tasting compound used as an antifreeze and brake fluid (WTF!!!), and most of the others I couldn't find (even using Google).  Then there are the 8 -- that's not a misprint; I said eight -- times sugar in its various forms are mentioned in the ingredient list: Sorbitol, Sucrose Fatty Acid Esters, High Fructose Syrup, Glucose, sugar (listed THREE times), sweet cooking wine.  Then after adding all that sugar, they added an artificial sweetener (Sucralose).<br /><br />I don't care how easy this is to make -- or how good it tastes!  With all the sugar it contains, anybody who is the least bit sensitive to sugar (for instance, diabetics or hypoglycemics) would really experience major sugar overload from eating it!"

2920,"I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).<br />I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent crap that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening).<br />Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed."
2921,"Amazon is scamming all the customers who buy this based on the reviews.  This webpage used to be for the Sugar-Free ""Caramel"" syrup made by Torani which I have been buying for years.  Recently, however, Amazon has been shipping the ""Classic Caramel"" flavor instead.  Classic Caramel, however, is a different product, and the taste is terrible.  I cannot get anyone in my household to drink coffees made with it.  Note that Amazon does not allow returns on grocery items.<br /><br />Please also see the review ""Flavor not what it usually is.""  I complained several times to Amazon that they were shipping the wrong product.  They assured me it would not happen again.  Appalling, but what Amazon did was to rename this SAME page to Classic Caramel and even change the picture.  But, note that the UPC is for the original ""Caramel"" product.  You will also find an occasional reference to ""Caramel"" on this page, but note that the reviews you see here are for a DIFFERENT product.<br /><br />Finally, do yourself a favor and get the plain Caramel and not the Classic Caramel.  It is 10X better.  I can go through a bottle of the regular Caramel in less than a week.  The regular Caramel is sooooo good.  In comparison, no one will drink the Classic Caramel.  Shame on Amazon.  They should have just made this Sugar-Free Caramel page ""No longer available"" (which it is elsewhere).  Note that they also added a second ""Classic Caramel"" page (with the correct UPC), but the description, etc., cut-and-pasted from this one.  Don't buy that either."
2922,"OK, so I became a coffeeaholic back in the 90's...since then I have tried just about every coffee imaginable....I have toiled with coffee presses...coffee grinders...pods...grind and brews...and you regular old drip mr. coffee pot.  I have owned at least 6 different machines not including espresso makers...so what's wrong, why can't I get a decent cup of coffee.  Oh sure, new machine I may like for a few months, but then it's back to mr. bitter coffee and many trips to DD and Starbucks...So what's wrong?  I'll tell you what's wrong, I kept passing by the $3 bag of 8 o'clock whole bean french roast with my nose in the air!  Fool!  I have been faithfully drinking this 8'clock coffee for 6 months now...I am beyond satisfied knowing EVERY cup will be a masterpiece.  I am now shunning DD and Starbucks...and my wallet thanks me.  Please give it a try...it will change your life...oh and, in case your interested, current coffee pot is a Melitta Mill & Brew which works well with the beans.<br />ENJOY!"
2923,"Many vocal critics of illy coffee have never actually tasted it. As Dr. House says, everybody lies and illy is apparently a very popular thing to lie about. I've caught several vocal critics lying about illy (by serving it to them, getting the typical ""This is fabulous!"" reaction, then telling them what they're drinking. You know, the Folger's Coffee Crystals technique).<br /><br />Why is this?<br /><br />Well, on the surface illy does appear to be frivolous and therefore an easy target.<br /><br />- It's very expensive, especially for coffee that comes in a can<br />- It's got a very fussy, very European marketing envelope around it<br />- It tends to be sold in fussy, trendy stores<br />- Because it's roasted and packaged in Italy, it is always several months old when you buy it<br />- Did I mention that it's very expensive?<br /><br />As a result, it's easy to dismiss illy as an elitist, ""image"" product that can't possibly be worth what it costs. And it's easy to convince others of the same thing, whether you've actually tried illy or not.<br /><br />The truth is illy is really superb coffee, just about the best I've ever tried. Since I've started drinking it at home, I've found I'm actually drinking much less coffee overall, because I only know a couple of places that serve illy locally and I just don't feel like bothering with anything else, at least most of the time. The ironic net effect of this is that illy may actually be saving me some money!<br /><br />I don't know if illy will be worth what it costs to you. There are some very good coffee beans sold by Costco for roughly 1/5 the price, much better than anything you can get at Starbucks or Peets. (In fact, if Starbucks or Peets is your idea of really good coffee, stop reading this now. Not because I think you're some tasteless boob, but because those brands are in the very modern, very successful mode of bitter, over-roasted, burned-tasting American coffee and I don't personally care for that. So if you like those brands, you're probably not going to like illy or any coffee that I like. Personally, I like the bottomless cup of Peerless my favorite diner serves much better than Starbucks.)<br /><br />What I do know is that if you like coffee enough to own a decent grinder and other caffeine paraphernalia, you really ought to try illy. In particular, if you like light-medium roasts but find most are just too wimpy, you may just love this stuff.<br /><br />If not, you'll at least have a cute, fussy  little can you can sub-divide some of your Costco walnuts into. And that is something."
2924,"I liked the flavor of this syrup at first, as did my wife.  It has a unique, natural taste, albeit not as sweet as the ""store-bought"" name-brand syrups that you find in the grocery stores.  But then again, apparently the sugar content is less, thus it is undoubtedly better for you. But, I guess that's pointless if you end up not wanting to use it.  My kids would not touch the stuff.<br /><br />Also, it is expensive for what you get.  I bought it at a special discount from the regular Amazon price, and it was still expensive even with the discount.  A bit too expensive, IMHO.  The photo can be a bit deceiving too; it comes in a very small jug...check the ounce figure carefully before making your buying decision.<br /><br />Edit - Sept 2010:  I thought I would update this review and let you know that after a few months, we ended up throwing this syrup away (about a third was left) because it had stayed on the shelf for so long, mold started to grow.  My kids continued to refuse to eat it.  Even I started going back to the store-bought brands. I read an interesting article in Esquire magazine that made me remember this product and my review...and made me smile:<br /><br />""People give 100 percent real maple syrup as gifts. People take their kids to farms to see it collected and cooked. In the Northeast, it's extolled. Which is strange, because it's not as good as Aunt Jemima or Mrs. Butterworth's, its mass market imitators. First of all, syrup shouldn't run, it should ooze. Real maple syrup runs. The mass market stuff - the stuff you grew up on - that stuff oozes. It has viscosity. So instead of going straight into the pancakes, like water into a sponge, it maintains their integrity. And the taste: Mass-market syrup is sweet.  Real maple syrup is a beguiling combination of sugar and resin. Which is authentic, sure. But bark is authentic.  Is there anything else we eat that tastes vaguely of tree?""<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better. I'll give it two stars instead of one because we did muddle through the stuff for a week or two and at least at first, perhaps because of the novelty, we though we liked it.  However, our enthusiasm quickly dwindled.  Think twice before you buy.<br /><br />Second edit: Sept 2010 - I found this information regarding real maple syrup, which may be why this Grade B version made me (and my kids) avoid it...apparently this grade is best for cooking:<br /><br />Here's how real maple syrups differ from each other...<br /><br />Grade A Light Amber or Vermont Fancy usually is made early in the season and has a mild, delicate flavor. It's often used for maple candies.<br /><br />Grade A Medium Amber is darker and has a more robust maple flavor. It's typically used for pancakes and waffles.<br /><br />Grade A Dark Amber, darker still, has strong maple and caramel-like flavors. It can be used for pancakes if you like a more intense flavor, as well as for cooking.<br /><br />Grade B is very dark and has the strongest flavor, mostly maple but also with hints of caramel. It's the best choice for cooking."

2926,"I've tried two of the major coconut oil brands that I order via the internet. I've been using the oil in food and on my skin for about 5 years. I ordered this just to see how it tasted because the price was so good, if it didn't taste right, I'd just use it on my skin. It is the BEST tasting oil I've tried. Tropical Traditions, Coconut Oil Supreme pale in comparison. This is truly a coconut oil you could eat right out of the jar. If you want to try a coconut oil that tastes as good as it smells, this is it. And the price is fabulous. Yea, Nutiva and Amazon!"
2927,"&quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes. <p>One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)"
2928,"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA"">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend."

2930,"There is nothing like fresh roasted chestnut.  But when these are not available, the French roasted chestnuts that come in a jar are typically the second best alternative but cost more than two and a half time these and do not have single serve packages.  These are the best alternative for a quick snack.  The drawback:  They are smaller, very dark and look very unappetizing although the taste is fine, but the only thing that makes me yearn for the French chestnuts is their moisture content.  Either the manufacturer is roasting these incompletely so they weigh more roasted than the French equivalent, or they must have problem with the manufacturing technique, or pack them while warm, increasing the moisture content in the bag.  At time they can be even sticky to the fingers.  Would I buy them again? Yes.  If money was no issue would I buy them? No.  I would buy the French roasted chestnuts in the glass jars. Better yet, I would have a maid roast them for me and peal them. LOL"
2931,"In this age of identity theft, government surveillance, Big Brother employers and airport screeners whose security checklist seems to include getting to third base, personal privacy is a real concern.

How to keep my secrets secret, and my privates private?<br /><br />The last thing I want is some stranger rummaging through my personal correspondence. So I hooked this baby up, drilled a couple of holes by the front door, and electrified the mailbox.<br /><br />This way, if anyone comes snooping around to sneak a peek at my mail, they'll get a letter, all right. The letter 'EEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!' And maybe a new frizzy hairdo.<br /><br />Of course, I didn't want to jolt my friendly local mail carrier. So I set the power supply on a timer -- it's off between 8 and 10am. But when the clock strikes ten -- *bzzzzzzzztttt*!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I forgot to tell the mailman right away, and he had a few... 'accidents' before we touched base.

2933,"Speaking as an obese and troubled man, I don't get many pleasures in my life. But one that I can always count on, even when everything else seems to be falling apart, is the delicious and juicy taste of an Albanese gummy bear. When my wife left me for reasons that I shan't go into in this review (suffice to say the gummies had NOTHING to do with it) who was there to comfort me? Certainly not my daughter, Sheila, who went off to college nearly a decade ago and doesn't even have time to send her FATHER a Christmas card. But Albanese was there. Albanese is always there, right on my doorstep, and every month 20-pound packages of gummies are stacked to shoulder-height.<br /><br />And so I ate. I ate and I ate and I ate through the night, tears soaking and moistening the sticky gummi mountain I had carefully crafted and was now laying upon, naked. That night I learned something, as my vision began to waver and my intestines began pumping a thin, painful stool through my body while diabetes ravaged my vital organs: these bears never stopped tasting good. Haribo bears, while having their own charm, really can't put the misery of two wasted decades out of your mind like Albanese can. And while the generic Wal-Mart brand gummies are cheap, I believe they have been proven to be carcinogenic when consumed with the vigor and volume that I enjoy.<br /><br />Yes, Albanese is truly the Gummi King. Five stars all around. Now if you'll excuse me, I believe I can feel a lone gummy still lodged in a fold of skin near my waist."
2934,"Chicken by-product, corn gluten meal, and whole ground corn?!!  Yeah, I'm NOT feeding my cat that, sorry. Googling ""corn gluten meal"" shows that it is used as an herbicide according to U.S. Patent # 5,030,268. If you Google ""U.S. Patent 5,030,268"" you will find out.  By-products are all the nasty parts of the chicken, turkey that humans won't eat: feet, neck, spleen, intestines that have bad effects on health. After all there are reasons why humans don't eat these parts, correct? So why should our pets? A good book that explains about by-products and manufacturing is The New Natural Cat by Anitra Frazier.  Because of these ingredients being in most cat foods, I buy Tractor Supply's 4HEALTH INDOOR dry food. Compare the ingredients in the Science Diet food to 4HEALTH and you will see the differences. 4HEALTH is a much better quality product with no corn, wheat or soy at HALF the price."
2935,"The first impression I had of this coffee was ""weak"". I used the same amount of coffee I always use. The next pot I used about 25% more coffee and it was better but still weak. I used even more the next time and although it was strong enough it just didn't have the full, bold richness I was expecting after reading the other reviews. I like a dark coffee, not bitter but almost and this isn't it. It's very smooth and subtle which I do not consider good qualities in coffee. Additionally, the beans were irregular in color, some quite dark and others light. They were also very hollow and brittle, not firm at all. This is an inferior coffee in my opinion."

2938,"I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now.  I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough.  It really does beat the burn.  The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package.  I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated.  It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.  I have been encouraging other fellow runners, triathletes, cyclist, backpackers, mountaineers, etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback.  Many nice climbing/outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product."
2939,"I'm gonna have to say that I bought this against my better judgement. So yes, it is my fault. Now that we got that out of the way: the basket. There's no other way to say it: the other bad reviews were right. I usually try and stay away from the bad reviews, because let's face it, most of the time it has nothing to do with the product and/or the person is just bitter. But really, this item looked like something you pick up at the dollar store. Seems like they scrapped whatever they could find together, put it in a cheap basket and mailed it out. Each item comes in a sealed plastic bag on top of shredded paper(?) in each section of the basket. You'd probably do a lot better spending 10 bucks somewhere and creating a basket yourself. But feel free to send this out if you want people to A. think you're cheap or B. Hate the person you are sending this to."
2940,"I received 3 months of Ice Cream from this Club as a gift. I was very disappointed with the Ice Cream I received and the giver was unhappy after seeing the choices I was sent each month. The first 2 months included a duplication of black walnut, a very bland vanilla frozen yogurt, some type of caramel,that didn't taste at all like caramel(I tried,but couldn't give it away), also 2 peppermint in one month. I emailed them after the 2nd month with my complaint,thinking they might want to take a second look at what was being sent. I did receive an immediate response, with an apology and an offer of an extra month of ice cream. They also told me they spoke with their shipper and was told my 3rd month was really going to be scrumptous. I just received it. May be somewhat better, but there is only one pint with higher butterfat then the average grocery store brand, 2 frozen custards, and 1 ""neopolitan""(how exciting)in a square cardboard carton and from a company not even mentioned in their ad. We have a number of Ice Cream stores in our city and thus far I have only received 1 pint each month that might compare. I felt I should write this review because the person who sent this gift had no reviews to read and had no idea that I might receive duplicates, along with the vanilla custard and neopolitan."
2941,"I bought a Slurpee flavored with this drink mix at 7-11 thinking I was making a healthy choice and it was not aware there was caffeine in this product and ended up sleepless and light headed for the last 24 hours. Caffeine is NOT healthy. I buy Crystal Light all of the time and I am VERY dissapointed that they have added this drug to their product. IT'S BAD FOR YOUR HEART, MIND AND BODY."
2942,"Ordered two 56oz bags. They arrived quickly, but most of the candies inside had broken shells, completely shattered shells, or where just reduced down to chocolate covered peanuts. The ones that did not break are coated with an layer of M&M shell shards from their murdered bagmates. Poor fellas had to watch their poor friends and family shatter then were violently dismembered right in front of them, left only to be covered in the skin and guts of those they love."
2943,"I bought this food because it seemed like an excellent choice of food for my cats. I gradually switched from Eukanuba to Innova Evo about three months ago because I wanted to provide better nutrition for my cats. Three of the cats adjusted well to the new food, but the fourth cat, Gutterball, started developing what seemed like ulcers or sores on her chin and on the top of her head. I immediately took her to the vet, and she was diagnosed with Acne caused by an allergic reaction to the new food. After a course of antibiotics, some acne medication,and switching their food back to Eukanuba, Gutterball is back to normal again. I still think that Innova Evo is a great cat food choice, but beware that some cats might get a bad reaction to it."
2944,I had not had a slim jim in 3 years. I brought these to quench my childhood thirst for this snack. I ate all 100 of them in about 18 days. I don't want to see another slim jim ever again in my life.<br /><br />The product was good though so no complaints.
2945,This product is not pure coconut water & pulp.<br />Contains Sugar. Do not recommend.
2946,"I am a long time daily user of Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk, which is usually excellent. Just got my first case from Amazon, and it doesn't remotely resemble the same product purchased elsewhere. What I just received is very thin and watery, with no flavor, no solids, and no cream at all. Even if refrigerated, entire contents can be easily poured out, no spoon required. If you have used this product before, you understand the difference.<br /><br />So I don't know if this is counterfeit, or mislabeled, or maybe manufacturer sends the bad batches to Amazon? I wrote very polite email to Thai Kitchen just asking what's up with this, and gave batch #'s and purchase data etc. Unfortunately, I did not receive the courtesy of a reply."
2947,"Organic Raw Agave is usually way over priced. Since I use it almost exclusivity as a sweetener in my raw food prep, I found it price-challenging when buying it at my local markets. Then I found this offering on Amazon.com. I get it auto-shipped each month, so I don't have to worry about running out. Now I pay a fraction of the price I used to pay. I did a taste comparison and it tastes exactly the sames as the pricier ones."
2948,How many calories?  How much fat/trans fat?  How much protein?  Full ingredients should be listed - they sound great but nutritional info should be supplied.<br /><br />Too much of a puzzle to order without knowing....<br /><br />Petunia
2949,"I first learned of the Keurig system almost ten years ago.  At that time, I worked for one of the largest marketers of the systems in our area.  I had the chance to sample almost every brand and their different brews.  Timothy's traditionally always made some of the best brews for the system.<br /><br />I have left the company, but kept my brewer.  I can still purchase anything I want at cost (if I drive the 30 miles to pick it up).  I choose to use Amazon's subscription for ease of use.  It is only a couple of bucks more than cost, and includes free shipping.  No more trips for coffee, and sure I miss the old mates, but this so worth it.<br /><br />The coffee is smooth and strong.  I prefer a very strong cup of Joe.  I typically make Americanos from my espresso machine (a 3 oz double shot diluted w/ 5 oz water).  That is close to what this tastes like.  I don't know about its acidity, but I can say that it is in line with my palate.  No bitterness (like one famous brand).  No creama, but really, what do you expect.  This is not espresso, it is a strong brew made from Arabica.  Really, just a quick quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />I also order the decaf.  It is just as good"
2950,"This is 100% organic, unrefined coconut oil.  Yes, it tastes like coconut, but it is supose to.  A food should taste like what it is!<br /><br />The nutritional value of this food is outstanding.  It contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial.  It is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils.  It requires very high heat to release free radicals (I do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all).<br /><br />My Suggested Uses:  smoothies, slow cooked baked goods, sauteed foods, mixed with maple syrup over popcorn, homemade cosmetics, and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair."
2951,"This decade candy basket makes an excellent gift for mom dad yourself,or your friends of all ages..These will go fast. You cannot go wrong.I just purchased this as a christmas gift...5 star rated."
2952,"The process of ordering was excelent as was the delivery.<br />Nutiva - Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 29 oz solid I do not like the smell when cooking with this oil. This oil also adds a coconut flavor to your cooking that I do not care for. I found ""Spectrum Naturals - Coconut Oil Organic"" to be a better choice for cooking no smell and no added flavor."
2953,"Yes, they do taste good, but they are just another sugar lollipop.  At least the Candy Tree Lollipops aren't amde with cane sugar (or evaporated cane juice)and actually taste like fruit - not sweet fruit."
2954,"This salmon would be most appealing to those who like a strong salty taste.  Normally, such as taste would also come with a wood fire taste/smell.  Not here: this fish is a combination of heavy salt and a very light smoke.  It comes packaged in a brine and it has a briney flavor to it.  If you like a heavy smoke taste or conversely a fresh fish taste avoid this product.<br /><br />I give it a subjective 1 star.  Some people might like it but I found that the salt taste obscured all else and left a distinctive salty aftertaste."
2955,"This is the best brand! [[ASIN:B000VUMSE0 Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 oz]I have been using more and more coconut oil for the past for months. First it was for facial moisturizer than learned how great it is for a whole body moisturizer. Use as you would baby oil. The I tried for my baby who has eczema and is allergic to just about all the ""pure"" and ""natural"" products out there. His skin drinks it in and leaves it super moisturized and smooth. No more cracks and irritation. Great for all seasons. My husband uses after shaving as do I. I love it for cooking, No more olive and canola. If you do your research this should be your only cooking oil. Whether savory or sweet or deep frying and sauteing. Has a very mild taste, my husband doesn't even notice the difference. Also try in your hair as a conditioner, hot oil treatment or sealant also cuticles. I am an african american woman with natural 4a hair. I can't say enough about this. I started with the 16oz, but the more I used this the more I found that I needed a larger size. To my amazement I found this gigantic size. I put some in my smaller containers and leave one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, one in the baby room and the largest one in the kitchen. Can't get enough of coconut oil."
2956,It didn't remove the spots... Now what am I going to do with all of the sponges I bought?
2957,"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier."
2958,"If you are new to ESE Pods, this is a great way to find the brands of pods you like best. Get this package and keep careful tasting notes - and remember, your machine will also work better with some pods than others. The idea is to experiment as much as you can for as little cost as possble and this sampler makes it easy.<br /><br />On my Francis! Francis! X3, the Espressione, Lavazza, and Caffe Mako seem to be the better of the bunch so far. But I'll probably be able reach a final consensus after my next sampler."
2959,"Good texture and flavor in this fresh, chewy and substantial bar. Two make a meal replacement when I have to work through a lunch hour."
2960,"Sure it's cruel.  All meat is cruel.<br /><br />Once you've set your moral rage aside, this liver is the finest you can buy without having a local supplier (which is a better option). This package is fully dressed...no veins or ducts...and cooks very well. The taste is precisely what you would expect from one of the finer gourmet suppliers in the world. The fact that it is duck means you're not spending as much and the flavor is right on.<br /><br />If you don't like meat, don't eat things that have to be killed to be eaten. If you do like meat and you love foie gras, then this product is a must-have."
2961,"I am very surprised that I felt the way I did after trying one of these 5 hour energy drinks.  I did not think there was that much caffeine in each one but apparently there is because I had the jitter attacks bi-time which started about ten minutes after I finished the bottle.  I got the sick feeling and it did not go away for, well about 5 hours actually.  I was very close to putting my finger down my throat to try to throw it up thinking maybe that would make me feel better, although I'm a pretty big wimp so I didn't do that.<br /><br />I am not overly sensitive to caffeine but while the 5-hour energy drink obviously works for some people, it did not work for me.  I tried green tea capsules about a week later (yes I was on the hunt for a good energy booster) and I have not had one negative experience to report.  I also recommend raspberry ketones which I take with the green tea, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008HYRW6G"">Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder</a>.  I think I found a good combination for me, finally.<br /><br />The only reason I need to take something for energy is because I start work at 5am everyday, which means I get up at 3:45am!  I try to stay away from coffee and based on my own experience and research green tea extract is the most natural and effective energy booster I know of that I can take without any side effects.  Hope this helps someone!"
2962,"When I recived my maca powder a lot of  it had leaked out in the shipping box.  I seems that you can't return grocery items so I feel basically cheated out of $15 bucks, because who wants to eat somthing that was shipped in a box damaged enough to leak. So..I say buyer beware"
2963,"I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is ""graphite"" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.<br /><br />I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.<br /><br />I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you'll know what I mean if you've owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).<br /><br />The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don't mind this for reasons I'll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it's ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.<br /><br />My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you'll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.<br /><br />I'm sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker."
2964,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better!"

2967,"Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states ""IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA"". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a ""Raw Food"" and not as ""Nutritious"" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40."
2968,"As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me.

2970,"I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of ""value pack"" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the ""new"" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release ""New Coke"" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those ""We heard you, and we're making it right"" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me."

Or in the case of the ""Sweet Potato & Chicken"" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.<br /><br />After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em - they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to ""real"" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too."
2976,"This bar has cranberries, almonds, and macadamia nuts (NOT bits and pieces!) as their main ingredients, in a soft honey-like glaze to keep it all together.  I refrigerate them in the summer or they kind of ""wilt"".  The ingredients are fresh, and the nuts are crunchy.  What I really appreciate about these bars is that it really takes time to eat and enjoy them.  Those nuts are meant to be chewed and not inhaled, unlike a lot of snacks that disappear as soon as you get the wrapper off.  I can't eat one in front of my favorite dog, as this is one snack I am too fond of to share with her... much to her dismay.  I think they are worth the cost, and I know they cost way more if you find them in a local grocery store."
2977,"I had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there, and love eating the powder raw. But Nutiva's product does not taste good at all, compared to the other products it tastes like dirt, and its not milled to a fine powder, its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything. The only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands. If your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with Living Harvest, Manitoba Harvest or Ruth's Hemp Protein. I eat hemp religiously so trust me, take my advice and avoid this one. Bottoms Up! Hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there, and easy to digest."
2978,"When I thought about buying these seeds there was only one other review. It was a good review so I decided to take a chance and buy the seeds. I am so glad I did. First of all they gave me a bonus package of seeds! And not one of the herbs that was already included in the set. The individual seed packets look exactly like the picture. They all have directions for planting the seeds, watering and sunlight exposure. All of my seeds have sprouted. There were no dead seeds. They certainly delivered the goods! and now it is all up to me. I would highly recommend Seed Needs for their herb seed packets. Great stuff!"

He will chew on the grass, lick it, and play with it too.  In addition to putting the grass near their food bowls (still in the pouch), I also snip bits of it into their food.<br /><br />I am not sure about the actual health benefits of this on my cats, but they seem to like it.  Even though 1 of my cats doesn't bother with it when it is in the pouch, she seems to like it in her food.<br /><br />Note:<br /><br />Just one pouch produces a lot of grass.  It does last quite a while as long as you keep watering it appropriately (my last batch is going on 3 weeks).  But, it is too much for my cats.  So, I split the amount in half.  When I open the pouch, I will divide the seeds and dirt.  I'll only put half in at a time.  Once the first batch goes dead, I'll add the second batch - I put it in the same pouch after rinsing it out."

This is then placed in a attractive retail type box<br />that would look right at home on the shelf next to kcups at your favorite retail store.<br />The front of the Box has a drawing of a kcup machine and a blow up of the 1 cup inserted in it.<br />It also lists a few of the compatible keurig type brewers it will work in.<br />The top and back of the box has some photos of environmental projects that the Rogers Family has been involved in.<br />one side has a photo of the rodgers family and their mission statement. The other side has a description of the coffee contained in the box.<br />I can see how these should sell well in the retail setting and also appeal to environment conscious individual and those who are just curious about a new alternative to the standard kcup.<br />I have a Box of Fog Chaser described on the box as a blend with the body of our regular roast and the smokiness of our French roast. A heavy full bodied with hints of cedar,vanilla and toasted almonds<br />balanced with a delicate finish with honey and milk chocolate flavors. Sure sounds appealing to me.<br />When I cut the seal on bag I'm hit with a very strong dark roast scent right away and something poignant but can't place the smell. Maybe it's the ceder they describe on the box and I'm intrigued to brew and try it.<br />Fits in my B70 perfectly and I use the 7.25 oz drop as I normally do. Smells good during brewing just like the extra bold dark roast Kcups I normally drink.<br />Brewed perfectly with no issues. Smells and tastes great in the Cup. Strong full bodied french roast with a smooth finish and I like it as does the wife.<br />I'm not one to name flavors and stuff like that so you will have to try it yourself for a more specific taste profile. Suffice it to say I give Fog Chaser a Big thumbs."

2983,"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive. Would not buy from them again."

2985,"After receiving the salt, I honestly believe it is overpriced for what you are getting.  I didn't think it was the ""best"" out there, although it gets rave reviews and is supposed to be very good for you.  I believe it is overpriced due to the marketing and overly-enticing packaging!  I probably won't order it again.  Not worth the money, the flavor is nothing unique."
2986,"This product is wonderful!  For a low-fat, low calorie alternative to peanut butter, this is the one.  I use the chocolate version - cocoa added.  It is still 90% peanut butter taste, with just a hint of cocoa and a little better color.  If you mix it with a little extra water, you have a good peanut dip or sauce for cooking."
2987,"Pet guardians, please take the time to educate yourselves on what goes into your pet's food. That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE. Good nutrition makes all the difference!"
2988,This tasted awful..like cardboard shavings...I did not try adding it to smoothies or anything...maybe that would help

2990,"Ordered the item on the 7th.. wasnt shipped until the 14th!! WAY BEHIND THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE! They did not offer any compensation for my inconvenience. When asked if they would express ship the item, they responded ""since we use proirity mail there is no guarenteed arrival date"". RIDICULOUS. I got this item FINALLY on Friday Oct. 17th (10 days after it was ordered... 5 days after the promised time frame) Product is just so-so. It only comes in a silver packaging, with a home-made looking logo on the bag. No Nutritional info, no ingredients. The communication was also very poor. took 2 emails befoe i got a response."

2992,"I suffer from Rosacea, which for me, is basically a bumpy rash on my face that burns and itches simultaneously (and looks hideous). I heard that Hemp Oil could help, and for the price was willing to try anything. What I found was astonishing! It was instantly soothing and much of the rash cleared up overnight. It's also a light, non-greasy moisturizer that doesn't make the rest of my skin break out. I have spent hundreds of dollars on prescriptions that did nothing but make my face burn and itch more and in months could not do what this stuff did in days. My rosacea is not completely gone. I still have flare ups, but it is under the best control it has ever been. I am not a doctor and have no idea why this works, but in my opinion its a miracle. Plus, it makes a darned tasty salad dressing too. What other product can do that?"
2993,"Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves--much less actually try it. The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.<br /><br />It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.<br /><br />And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.<br /><br />My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.<br /><br />If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).<br /><br />I hope some of this proves helpful."
2994,"I prefer the Spectrum coconut oils. Because they are flavorless, they have more potential uses."
2995,"Basically it does just want it says.  Get a juice, any 100% juice with more than the required amount of sugar per serving, drop in the powder, place the supplied air seal on the bottle, and wait two days.  In return, you'll get a nice bubbly drink that tastes similar to mixing whatever juice you used with a hard cider.  I used white grape, and probably should have picked a hardier variant.  It would be a great drink for a party punch bowl (since it's relatively inexpensive per serving), or a hot summer day.<br /><br />One thing to note, when you've reached the desired fermentation, remove the yeast from the bottom.  If not, it will continue fermenting, even if you put it in the fridge.  I did this by pouring the juice on the top into a pitcher, and leaving the sludge in the bottom of the juice bottle.  Just wash it out, and put the juice back in, and you're set.<br /><br />Also, be sure to keep the airlock on the bottle once it's in the fridge.  Don't use the bottle cap!  Since the yeast is still doing its job, if you use the bottle cap, pressure will cause an explosion."

2999,"I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except ""sweets,"" of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"
3000,"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."
3001,"We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price."

3004,"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI"">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, ""nutrition"" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of ""yummy."").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to ""gourmet it"" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As ""rice"" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with ""noodle heaven""; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As ""oatmeal"" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than ""outside-the-waves"" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (翻) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate ""lid""; zap it for another minute or half, then let it ""steep"" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate ""lid"" I can just place it on the table for family style ""digging in.""<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Arrowhead Mills, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelinas have been added to my list of  purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the ""naked"" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of ""health""?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had ""lived"" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O"">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon"
3005,"Outstanding gourmet taste: the blend of mushrooms, steak and sauce is tantalyzing.  The orders could be divided, so that the entire order doen't have to be defrosted at once.  Possibly divide the large portion into three or four smaller ones. As it stands the order is easily microwavable."

3008,"Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container.

Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors?

3011,"Pros: Endless list i.e. lack of grains, high quality protein, appeal to the dog's palate, lack of stool, vitamins and minerals, no by products, fillers, or possibly dangerous ingredients, availability at you local Petco. The list goes on and on.<br />Cons: As Expensive as dog food gets (Over $2 lb). Price is the only con for me, the protein content could be an issue for some less active breeds than Boxers. The largest bag size is 24 lb. I wish they had a 40lb bag at a lesser price per pound.<br /><br />First off, this is the highest rated, best quality food that can be purchased at Petco, without question. This is the only blue buffalo line (Wilderness) in that class as well. It is not advertised as an allergy free dog food, but it definitely is due to the fact there are ZERO grains. I thought the high protein content would be an issue for my dog based on issues with other high protein foods, but that is not the case with the Blue Buffalo Wilderness. When I change foods, I want to make sure I can buy it locally in the event I need some on the fly. I love a website called dogfoodanalysis.com, and this is the only 6 star rated food that Petco sells, and most every other food except a few (Wellness is one exception although my dog didn't like it) are rated 3 stars or less. For example, Natural Balance, regardless of the flavor is rated 3 stars. Brands like Iams, Science Diet, Eukanuba, Purina Pro Plan all get horrible 1 ratings at best because they are so full of garbage ingredients, unnecessary fillers and by-products. Many of the foods that cost as much as this or close are also rated 1-2 stars.<br /><br />I have a 2 Yr old Boxer, and owned 2 before that. All of them have had soft stools the majority of the time, and 2/3 had hot spots on the fur causing them to scratch themselves constantly. Over the years, I have tried a number of premium dog foods such as Solid Gold, Nature's Recipe, Natural Balance, as well as some cheaper foods such as Iams. My dogs really never loved or even liked most of these foods, and generally wouldn't start eating the food when the bowl was put on the floor unless I poured some low sodium chicken broth on the food.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo Wilderness is like candy for my dog, but is the most healthy by far at the same time. With other foods that cost as much as this food, he has never looked forward to eating, and never had a proper stool.<br /><br />I am a very harsh critic of most things, and am great at playing devil's advocate. I have nothing bad to say about this food other than the price becasue it truly seems no corners were cut, and Blue Buffalo is offering the best quality dog food on the market. However, the price is probably justified unlike any of the other expensive , but not necessarily good quality dog foods. After 2 weeks eating this food, he is filling out, seems much less hyperactive, his hot spots are disappearing (I feel due to the lack of any grains from my research), he's pooping less and more solidly. Since the last food he was eating gave him the runs anyway, I never mixed the old food with the new, and the first time he pooped, it was more solid than ever before.<br /><br />If you can afford this food (I barely can), do not hesitate to go buy it now. There were no corners cut in the design of this food. It is truly top quality dog food that is the next best thing to making your own dog food which will cost even more.<br /><br />If you own a Boxer, you know how messy they are when eating! They love filling their mouth with kibble, then dropping half of it on the floor, and not eating all of the leftovers on the floor. My dog is so addicted to the Wilderness food that he will find every last piece of kibble that he scattered on the floor, and gobbles it up.<br /><br />I prefer the Salmon"
3012,"Since I was introduced to finishing salts, I've never been able to go back to plain old table salt. I highly recommend trying a sampler set of salts to see which one(s) you like before buying larger quantities, and it's also nice to have a variety of salts for different tastes and food/uses. Finishing and Gourmet salts are not just for Foodies, but for the average cook as well.  It is fun to try them on different combinations of food. You don't need to worry about getting too much salt in your diet if you omit salt during cooking and add a pinch on fresh, pure, non-processed foods at the table or upon serving.  Not only do finishing salts improve the flavor of so many foods, but they can add to the presentation.<br /><br />A salt sampler makes a great gift, but if gifting, buy the bottles instead of the tins - they would make a much more attractive gift. I got the tins because I needed small and light containers, but you wouldn't want to set them out on the table or keep them anywhere visible.<br /><br />As for this particular sampler and the seller:  It was shipped very quickly, and the quality of salts is fine, however -- it would have been helpful had they indicated the quantity (weight) of salt for the taster tins in the description.  It is indicated for every container, except the tins. (It varies: .6 oz., .9 oz., and 1 oz. depending on the density of each salt).  It would also be helpful if each label was on the top of the tin instead of the bottom so you don't have to turn each one upside down to identify the one you are looking for - unless you are able to see through tin.  The informational brochure that came with them would have been great - IF the type was large enough to read!  I had to use a magnifier and still couldn't read some of it because of the poor quality printing in addition to the tiny size, and I have 20/20 vision."

3014,"One taste was all it took for me. I tried Lavazza at a local coffee house in Denver and really enjoyed the taste. No bitterness at all. Very full flavored coffee.<br /><br />I came across this as the word ""Crema"" caught my eye. Now I am ordering it using the subscribe and save. It is running me $17.41 for every order and that's with free 2 day shipping because of the Prime Membership.<br /><br />Each brick lasts about 10 days for 2 people drinking 6 cups of coffee every morning. I use 1 tablespoon coffee for every 6 ounces of water brewed in a Target Michael Graves design automatic drip coffeemaker. The ""Flavor"" button really brings it out in this coffee. I love my coffee with half and half and it really seems to compliment it well.<br /><br />The packages are vacuumed sealed and take up very little space. It really is a 5 star coffee."
3015,"I am too tired to do a video review. Maybe, I will do one later. This oil is a must have for ladies with natural hair. I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do ""baby"" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well."
3016,"Buyer Beware!!!!!  I ordered two of these back in April 2008, I never received them and my e-mails were promptly ignored--when I contacted a salesman in august--I got lots of flowery words with a promise to double my order and have seen nothing--fortunately I purchased it through Amazon and they refunded my money."

3018,I found about this sauce here [...] because I was looking<br />for some great BBQ sauce and this product showed up. I read all of<br />the great reviews and I was planing to add it to marinate my Christmas<br />Turkey but after tasting it...I will not be doing that. This sauce was<br />disappointing. It wasn't as delicious as people say it is. I'll tell<br />you...it tastes kind of like Pico Pica salsa only Pico Pica tastes much<br />better and is much cheaper and you can pick up a bottle of Pico Pica Hot Sauce and Mild sauce at many stores and here on Amazon. So...just to<br />describe the taste...it tastes like a little Pico Pica and some other<br />cheap mild Mexican hot sauce only it's not that great. But...I have<br />yet to try it on any foods yet but I will since I paid for one bottle.<br />Buy a Pico Pica Mild sauce. That tastes 5 times better and is only like<br />$2.95 or less.

3025,"I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult ""crisis"" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try ""The Magnesium Factor"" by Margaret Seelig or ""The Magnesium Miracle"" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!"
3026,"The flavor of this stevia blend reminds me of artificial sweeteners.  The more you use per serving, the more distinct the ""not sugar"" taste is pronounced.  Of course, it has its benefits as it is a natural sweetener rather than a chemistry experiment.  Given the choice of an artificial chemical sweetener or this product, I'd go with this product even though it's a little expensive.  Those with diabetes or who are GI conscious may also want to explore using agave nectar.  Where stevia has no calories, agave has a caloric load similar to that of honey (though it has a very low GI). Agave's flavor is fairly neutral (in the light varieties) so its ""sweet"" flavor is less at odds with the flavor of sugar.<br /><br />I think this product is ""ok"" - but I can't say that I like it well enough to give it 4 stars.  There's no way I'd use it as a sugar substitute for cooking.  It's fine in beverages, but if you have a penchant for over sweetening your drinks (southern sweet tea is traditionally very sweet, for example) you're likely going to notice the ""it's not sugar"" taste.  If you use artificial sweetners already, I'd say give this a try.  But don't switch from sugar to stevia and expect to be delighted."
3027,"Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free."

3030,"I also received the wrong tree the first time.  The first tree came quickly but was also the Gardenia tree.  After contacting Amazon they reshipped the correct tree.  It came quickly and was packed properly.  Upon arrival the tree looked good, but it quickly changed.  I have, in the past, grown Bonsai trees with success.  They do require attention and proper watering as well as light and growing conditions.  Both trees came in ceramic pots that did not match the description.  They were different colors and different from the photos on the site.  The gardenia tree did loose most of its leaves, but had new growth somewhat quickly afterwards.  This review is about the tree that I ordered.  This Fukien Tea Tree started to loose all of its leaves and appeared to be in distress.  I kept it watered, gave it great morning and afternoon light and maintained the temp around 75 degrees.  After several weeks, the tree has lost almost all of its green growth.  I had an expert view the tree and this gentleman seemed to think that the soil that the tree was planted in was too dense and didn't allow for any oxygen to reach the roots.  He seemed to think that the Gardenia tree was ok, but not the Fukien Tea tree.  He didn't think that transplanting the tree this soon after receipt would help since these trees need time to adjust to their new surroundings.  Also mentioned in the directions that came with both trees.  He also noticed some fertilizer beads in the soil which to him might also might not be the ""ideal"" for the tree.  He recommends a water based food mixed in with the water a given to the tree weekly.<br /><br />I wonder if all of these ""conditions"" were done to the tree since they had to send it to me to correct their ""first"" error of the wrong tree.<br /><br />Even though I love Amazon, I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing a Bonsai tree to select one from a local source.  These local Bonsai retailers are more interested in helping you get a perfect tree and have more a vested interest in your success than Brussel's does.<br /><br />Not that $50 is that much more than a good bunch of flowers from a florist, you still expect your tree to live for years."
3031,"We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price."

3033,"There are 4 primary sources for cinnamon used in cooking. Ceylon cinnamon is ""true"" cinnamon and is not toxic, the Saigon, Cassia and Burmannii contain high amounts of coumarin (1200x the amount of ceylon) a toxic compound that affects the nervous system. Simply organic uses the latter of the four because it is cheap do to having an extremely low oil content. Basically it is junk. If your cinnamon is bitter and not sweet (and this is) it is toxic. So just because it is ""organic"" does not mean it is good for you. I bought some hoping that it was right because none label their sources and am severely disappointed. On a side note the same is true of imitation vanilla having dangerously high amounts of coumarin from using the Tonka do to the fact it contains a lot of vannillan."

3035,I'm sure the flaw with this product is with coconut water in general and not with Zico. I gasped when I first sipped this drink.

3039,"I use these for several reasons.  They are great if your 'throughput' is a little sluggish, they will help you up your water intake (because they are VERY dry), and they stop carb cravings because they fill your stomach.  I spread a little sugar free jelly or Walden Farms sugar free chocolate sauce on them to help ease the dryness.  Don't get me wrong, you need to like the taste of bran.  They are sort of like all-bran got stomped by an elephant and made into a wafer.  I eat them to stop my pacing the kitchen late at night or to cure the same thing around 3:30 in the afternoon, which allows me to stay on my eating program."
3040,"I was really excited about ordering this set and thrilled when it came.  I have noticed something unexpected about the teas, however.  With the teas I have tried from this set I have noticed an unpleasant dry aftertaste.  Another taster noticed the same thing without my mentioning it.<br /><br />I really like the glass tea pot.  It is very nice to watch the tea fill the glass orb with color and flavor.  Whether the flowers are beautiful or look more like sea urchins will be a matter of personal taste.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Starlight Rose Tea (white tea leaves with rosebud) and found it far inferior to Rose Petal Black Blended Tea by The Republic of Tea, which is excellent.  On the other hand, Numi's Moroccan Mint is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted, superior to an old favorite of mine- Stash Tea Moroccan Mint.<br /><br />After tasting this tea I am surprised by the number of reviews rating the tea that comes with the set as quite good.  Maybe I got a bad batch or have strange taste buds- but there it is.<br /><br />The bamboo box is quite charming."
3041,"Have ordered this in lots of 4-6 bags several times in the past. The dogs really like this food. However, yesterday UPS dumped four practically destroyed cardboard boxes on my front porch. One box was so damaged the dog food bag inside had the end torn completely open. Spent awhile sweeping up all of the spilled kibbles. So much for the convenience of ordering dog food online. From now on I will make a bulk purchase locally instead. That way I might be able to get a larger bag, and if not, at least it will be intact when I get it to the house."
3042,I guess my palate is not as sophisticated as I had thought. I'm a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. I tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. I have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. I gave mine away (ananomously).
3043,"This is a wonderful array of some classic Indian dishes. They are very nicely spiced, very flavorful, and good alternative to expensive take-out.

Everyone's taste buds are different and everyone's perception of what tastes good in a sweetener is different.  I have done my best to describe this product, but in the end you will have to taste it yourself and see what you think.<br /><br />FULL REVIEW:<br />Nectresse is the latest no calorie sweetener from McNeil Nutritionals.  It is an admixture of Erythritol, sucrose, monk fruit (luo han guo) extract, and molasses.  The combination adds another low calorie sweetener to the mix and generally successful, depending on the application.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE:<br />Nectresse is supplied in small nearly 1/2 teaspoon, 2.4 g packets (for comparison there are 4.2 g of sugar per teaspoon). That said, 1/2 teaspoon of Nectress supplies the same sweetness as two teaspoons of sugar.  The packets are thicker foil packets, not the paper packets such as sugar an other sweetners are often packaged in.  This is likely due to the need to protect the Nectress from moisture in the environment, as it is likely more hygroscopic (moisture absorbing) than other sweeteners. The Nectress itself is slightly yellow in color but it has the same texture as sucrose, mimicking a very light, blonde sugar.  It mixes easily in hot or cold beverages and handles very similarly to sugar for these kinds of applications.<br /><br />RAW TASTE:<br />When tasted directly out of the packet, the Nectresse is almost as cleanly sweet as table sugar, but it has some slightly honey overtones.  Overall, this is a very pleasant sweetness.  There is no bitter after taste when tasted cold: if you try the directly out of the package taste test with most Stevia brands, the result is a shocking bitter after taste.  Plain erythritol has a cleaner, sucrose sweetness but is plagued with a very pronounced and to some disturbing cool after sensation (kind of like you get with mint or menthol, without the mint or menthol taste).<br /><br />On the upside, the sweetness factor is really quite good, depending on the application the taste is nearly as good as sugar.  When sweetening cold beverages (ice tea, lemonade) the Nectresse really shined.  The sweetness level was robust and it was hard to distinguish from sugar.  The honey-like overtones may not jibe with every application, but these were at least pleasant overtones as compared to other non-sugar sweeteners.<br /><br />Sadly, when used in hot beverages, such as coffee, there is a slightly perceptible, bitter aftertaste.  This is similar to the aftertaste you might get from Stevia, but not nearly as pronounced.  Unlike Stevia, the taste is simply bitter--there are no licorice after tones.  The more sweetener used, the more the bitterness. If you like your coffee lightly sweet, you may not notice it.  If you like your coffee on the more intensely sweeter side, it is noticeable.  That said, the bitter taste is less pronounced in hot tea, possibly secondary to the acidity.<br /><br />Please note, that the bulk of the sweetness here is likely from the monk fruit extract.  Monk fruit is about 150 times as sweet as sugar, so you would only need very tiny amounts of monk fruit extract for sweetness.  The erythritol, sugar, and molasses are added to add bulk, texture, and consistency to the product, so that it more closely resembles and behaves like table sugar.  They may also compliment or balance the taste of the product, but can't account for the level of sweetness.<br /><br />(There is only 1/2 teaspoon of product per package: erythritol is only 70% as sweet as sugar--it would take more than 2 1/2 teaspoons of erythritol to equal the sweetness of 2 teaspoons of sugar. And quite obviously, even 1/2 teaspoon of sucrose couldn't get you the equivalent of 2 teaspoons of itself.  Molasses is not as sweet as sugar and has a distinctive taste, so there's not enough molasses in the mix to account for the sweetness. )<br /><br />BAKING:<br />On the FAQ section on Nectresse's website, it was mentioned that you could bake with Nectresse.  Ever interested in experimentation, I decided to give it a try.  I used a simple sugar cookie recipe and baked three kinds of cookies sweetened with: 1) sugar; 2) Nectresse; and 3) pure erythritol. I commandeered my 9 and 12 year-old kids for the bake off.<br /><br />Please note: I do realize that different sweeteners have different properties.  To keep things easy, however, I simply replaced the sugar in the recipe with either Nectresse or erythritol. I do realize that the different products have different sweetness levels and different chemical properties and are not so easily interchangeable, so you should take the results of the little experiment with a grain of salt (real salt).  Even so the results were enlightening.<br /><br />After a family taste test, the results were as follows (drum roll please):  Sugar came in first, followed by Nectresse, followed by erythritol.<br /><br />1) Sugar had the best consistency and the best sugar cookie taste.  Cosmetically, the sugar cookies also spread more evenly and looked better than the other cookies.<br />2) Nectresse had excellent sweetness in this application.  You might have expected cookies that were far too sweet, given that volume for volume Nectresse should be about 4 times as sweet as sugar.  Even so, the sweetness after baking was comparable and quite good. In the cookie, at least, there was no evidence of the bitter after taste and in spite of the Nectresse containing some erythritol filler, there was no 'cooling effect' on the tongue.  The cookies failed on the level of texture.  The weren't as crisp as the real sugar cookies.  Still, you could imagine if the company can mix the Nectresse with the right kind of fillers for baking, it might be able to perform really well.<br />3) Erythritol cookies were more like the pure sugar cookies in texture, but, on a taste, they failed on a couple of levels.  The sweetness was pristine, but due to the fact that erythritol is only about 70% as sweet as sugar, the erythritol cookies didn't quite reach the level of sweetness needed in a sugar cookie.  I am still glad that I didn't weight out 1/3 more of the erythritol to get the comparable amount of sweetening, however, because the 'cooling effect' was out of control.  (Erythritol has a peculiar cooling effect on the mouth--kind of like the cooling effect you get by eating mint or menthol, but without the mint or menthol flavor.)  Even at the lower level of sweetness, the cookies had an unacceptable level of cooling that was a bit of a turn off for the family.  (Had they been mint flavored sugar cookies this might have been okay, but with the plain flavor, the kids and I felt the cooling effect was overwhelming.)<br /><br />WHAT IS IN NECTRESSE:<br />The most touted ingredient of the combination is monk fruit.  Monk fruit is really not new to the sweetener scene.  In the past, the sweetener was mostly marketed as luo han guo and has been used in the far east, mostly to sweeten cold beverages and often in combination with other sweeteners (natural and artificial).  The raw fruit extract is usually refined, allowing the removal of interfering flavors. It has been marketed in the past as a sugar substitute, the most well known brand of which is Lakanto (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079OL6T4"">Lakanto, All Natural Sweetener, 800 grams</a>).  I have always been interested in tasting Lakanto, but the price tag is prohibitive.<br /><br />Although monk fruit is the main ingredient, Nectresse also has other ingredients.  Erythritol, sugar (sucrose), and molasses are added to balance out the flavor, texture, and consistency.<br /><br />IS IT NATURAL?<br />McNeil is marketing Nectresse as a natural sweetener, in contrast to Splenda (sucralose), McNeil's flagship artificial sweetener.  Nectresse may be natural, but there may be a few caveats here. The fact that McNeil Nutritionals is a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, a big pharma company not known for a 'crunchy granola' outlook might give one some pause.<br /><br />On the downside, there is no indication that the sweetener is derived from non-GMO sources.  The major ingredient, Erythritol, is often refined from corn.  Sugar and molasses are well known, but are also the products that this sweetener was designed to replace (and that most users want to avoid).  In all fairness, the fact that Nectresse has nearly 0 calories per serving  tells you that sugar and molasses content is very low and that they were probably added to subtly balance the taste and/or add consistency to the product.  This is not all that different from adding dextrose (glucose) and maltodextran to Splenda brand products.  There is less than a gram of these products in Splenda.  These products are added to Splenda as a filler for the sucralose and to balance taste and consistency.<br /><br />That said, Nectresse is not exactly a 'zero' calorie option, but a very minimal calorie option.  The FDA allows for products to advertise as 'zero' calories if they have less than 5 calories per serving.  My guess is that after you get beyond two packets, you exceed the 5 calories per serving.  Still not too bad, as the sweetness of two packets of Nectresse is the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Although Nectresse may be derived from natural sources, all the natural source may be refined to a point that is not acceptable to all customers.<br /><br />COMPARED TO OTHER LOW CALORIE SWEETENERS:<br />I think that Nectresse compares fairly with other low calorie sweeteners.  Obviously, the choice of sweeteners that you use is mostly dependent on your personal taste.<br /><br />I can only speak for my own taste buds, but Nectresse scores very high for me.  It is very nearly up there with xylitol and erythritol, in terms of a pure sucrose taste.  When it comes to tasting like sucrose, I'd have to give xylitol a bit of an edge here, but xylitol fails at higher amounts of intake due to GI side effects (e.g. diarrhea).  Erythritol is also more purely sweet than Nectresse and generally does not come with GI side effects, but is dogged by that overwhelming cooling effect that can occur at sweetening concentrations.  Still, I'd rather use xylitol or erythritol in my hot coffee than Nectresse, as Nectresse has that bitter taste with hot coffee.  In cold beverages, however, Nectresse wins hands down.  There are a lot of stevia fans out there and I wish them well, but even brands with lesser bitter aftertastes still have a bitter edge that kills it for me and the sweetness of stevia seems to range from a cotton candy like taste to licorice overtones; sweet but not sugar-like.  Sadly, stevia just doesn't do it for me.<br /><br />Compared to the artificial sweeteners, the best of the crowd for sweetening my morning coffee would be Equal.  I think that Nectresse compares favorably to this and I would use Nectresse rather than Equal if I had the choice. (Equal, for me, has a fairly good sweetness, but it is not quite comparable to sugar.)  Nectresse beats Splenda (sucralose) hands down, for me, as I prefer the very slight bitterness to that wacky, artificial aftertaste that I get with Splenda.  Ditto for saccharine, which just doesn't do it for me.  Saccharine never tasted quite like sugar to me and has a bitter aftertaste that overwhelms.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />All in all, Nectresse is a more than respectable alternative, low calorie sweetener. For my palate, it is comparable to most other natural sugar substitutes for taste and beats the artificial sweeteners hands down. Sadly, though,none of the alternatives tastes or handles perfectly like table sugar.  But after trying Nectresse out, it is definitely something that I will use in the future."
3045,"We are chip fanatics in our house and we decided to try these because of their claim of being a ""healthier"" alternative to regular chips.  I will admit that they have a great crunch - something between a ricecake and a kettle chip.  The texture is also very nice, again - similar to a ricecake, but with a great potato flavor.  The big issue with these is the sodium level.  After about four or five chips they're almost unbearable because of the salt and you really stop tasting anything but the salt.  A review of the nutritional facts showed that the sodium per serving was almost double that of a standard potato chip serving and that was for their ""original"" flavor...I can't imagine what the ""Salt & Pepper"" style must be like.<br /><br />I would buy these regularly if they cut the salt by about 75%.  Because of the salt factor, I don't think you can call these a ""healthy"" alternative to chips."
3046,"I was sent a box of Uncle Eddie's by my young niece, a convert to veganism after a recent - and by all accounts, traumatic - school trip to the local abattoir.<br /><br />Not being of the vegan persuasion myself, I was unaccustomed to animal-free comestibles. The chewiness of the cookies was surprisingly pleasant, although they definitely lacked the flavour of their traditionally-made cookie cousins due to the absence of butter and other ethically-incorrect animal ingredients.<br /><br />Happily this minor disappointment was easily remedied by immersing the cookies in a shallow bath of warmed lard prior to ingestion. Personally, I prefer the fuller flavour of unrendered lard (obtained from the fatty deposits surrounding the pig's kidneys) but feel sure that the cheaper varieties made from the hard fat between the back skin and the flesh of the pig will suffice for people with less refined palates.<br /><br />By following my advice for post-production animal fat insertion, you can now guzzle guilt-free without compromising on the flavour."
3047,"We're suffering a heat wave, and it was a sweltering 103 degrees here yesterday. Since my air conditioner went out and the repairman couldn't come until Monday, my daughter Allie decided to get me out of the heat ... a drive to see some friends, followed by a nice dinner in a cool, relaxing restaurant.<br /><br />The ac in her car felt like Heaven, so after I got comfortable, I reached for my water bottle.  When I did, Allie handed me this tiny packet (resembled an elongated version of those packets of salt in fast-food places), instructing me to pour it into my water. She knew I liked Crystal Light lemonade, so thought I would like this too. My bottle held 16.9 ounces of water and since I had already drunk half, it was perfect for eight ounces of this delicious drink. I tapped the powder into the water, swirled the bottle to mix it well, then took a sample sip. I liked it so well, I gulped with gusto.<br /><br />I've always appreciated the health benefits of green tea and the flavor of mangos, so it was a no-brainer that I'd like this tasty beverage. How well my daughter knows me!<br /><br />Allie nodded when I told her I had never seen these tiny packets, since the lemonade had come in small tubs that made an entire pitcher, and she laughed when I raved over the convenience and ease of use, marveling at the genius of the manufacturer.<br /><br />When I came on-line to order this viitamin-enhanced green tea peach mango mixture and the lemonade for the kids, I did some quick math, realizing that when mixed with filtered tap water, the price per eight ounces is thirty-two and one-quarter cents a bottle. I prefer the 16-oz. bottles, so I use two of these packets, which figures to be sixty-four and a-half cents. ... Much cheaper than soda--and decidedly tastier and healthier!<br /><br />I ordered this mixture for myself and lemonade flavor for my grandchildren. Johnny doesn't like water too much, so hogs every bottle of soda that we buy. I plan to give him his own supply to take to school because they fit so easily into his pocket and are so easy to mix on the run.<br /><br />One final tip Allie passed on: Some of her friends simply add a half- or fourth-packet, preferring a milder refreshing.  Sounds good to me!  Thanks, Allie ... not only for treating me to dinner but for introducing me to a healthy new taste treat, one that I can mix on the go!<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />author of: Millennium Babe: The Prophecy"
3048,"Originally, I felt the same way the other reviewer did about these, but then my boyfriend told me to add about a tablespoon of oil to the water (maybe a little more) as they were cooking and they weren't all clumpy and sticky anymore.  They work great for me as I can't eat gluten and brown rice pasta seems to raise my blood sugar more than I'd like. The corn in quinoa pasta is out for me too! Allergies.  This is a perfect alternative so I'd highly recommend it.  It tastes good in stir fries and with tomato sauce!<br /><br />Update: Oddly, I did the oil thing and they still got clumpy this past time.  We discovered if you rinse them with water while they are in the strainer, as soon as you take them out of the pot, they separate and are perfectly normal again.  Hope this helps!"
3049,"I found these first at my local supermarket.  I've been looking for a blend that I could use as my standard every-day cup of coffee and, finally, this was it.  I've tried so many of the other blends and brands and they were either harsh and bitter (I know, some people think coffee *should* taste that way!) or too bland and weak. This is smooth but with a nice ""coffee"" presence you can actually taste.  *Coffee* taste, not burned grounds!<br /><br />I highly recommend this if you're *not* into the ""make your hair stand on end"" type of coffee. This review is based on using the ""medium"" size on the coffee machine.  You may get different results if you use the small or large dispenser sizes."
3050,The taste of the coffee was very bitter and smelled horrible.  Though the capsule concept is more convenient the product quality has to deliver and this does not at all meet expectations.  The flavor was 'off' and tasted under-roasted and foul.
3051,I have used Wellness Core for a long time.  I did a lot of research before choosing it.  However after getting a new bag that was moldy I started doing some research.  The company has been bought out and many many consumers have complaints about the quality control of the food now and in some cases their dogs have been getting sick on it.  I am not saying not to buy it but just beware that it is not the same company anymore.
3052,"This goes great with the pelt, whiskers, and bunny eyeballs that I purchased on eBay. Now I have a whole rabbit! Thanks!"
3053,"Until recently a local health & nutrition store carried Bob's Red Mill products, no one else has it.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and even happier when I saw the price.  It is much less expensive to order through Amazon, and even fresher than buying in a store.<br /><br />All of Bob's Red Mill products are of high quality and very fresh.  An excellent company to buy organic products from!"
3054,"Product seems ok but, is shipped in a flimsy cellophane bag that cannot be reclosed.  (Note that the photograph of the product appears to show the rim of a jar, but the ad intentionally avoids a description of the packaging.)  A cheap jar with a screw on lid would not have added much to the price."
3055,The same pack is sold in costco for $9.99<br /><br />Quinoa is good for health.  I give 5 star for the grain itself. but not from this buyer.
3056,"NOW has a policy to use Non-GMO'd products when possible BUT they can't guarantee that this product is produced from NON-GMO corn.  With their low prices and the majority of corn produced in the US is GMO'd, I have to assume it's a GMO'd product.  Isn't that just great!!!!  And, Amazon has a NO RETURN policy on food items, so I am stuck with it."
3057,"Look at the ingredients, folks! How many different types of sugars and syrups are in there? If you think this is healthy, you are wrong!<br />Now if you want a sweet candy bar, this stuff is great. It does taste good, just please don't think you are doing your body a favor by eating these over loose, lightly sweetened granola or a bowl of fresh fruit or vegetables :)"
3058,"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though. I was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and I was paying almost twice as much as on Amazon. Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly."
3059,"I had my skepticism, I start with that because if you like what you already drink what could an aerator do to it?  Well it does enough for me to keep this little tool out and nearby my good alcohol.  I did the old side-by-side non aerated to aerated single shot taste test.  For the really cheap clear alcohol all I can say it does is make it have less of a burn while drinking and actually smooths out the after taste to a nice fade off.  As for higher end, scotch in my case, I tried a 12 year single malt & a 17 year old single malt.  Starting with the 17 year old scotch, this stuff is smooth and great to begin with, the side-by-side test concluded with the aerated scotch being much more floral/aromatic, the after taste was MUCH more enjoyable as it seemed to melt into a buttery feeling and just faded off into bliss.<br />The 12 year old scotch, it's good on the rocks and a splash of water.  With the aerator it turned a 12 year old scotch into a very close 15/16 year old scotch.  All the little notes of flavor came to live, I won't way it is perfect but a cheaper bottle of scotch in my cabinet just payed for this little aerator.  All the harshness and lingering after taste of the 12 year old scotch, just melted away.  Again not on the same level as the 17 year old but pretty darn close.  I can put the max of 2 full jiggers, or more :), and know that what comes out will be a nice drink all around.<br />For the $$, I'd suggest you give this a shot (or 2) if you like to enjoy a fine liquor.  I know I will defiantly be keeping this at close hand when making my drink, or drinks for others.  I'm very tempted to by a few for some good friends and family to spread the enjoyment.  The stopper and release button are NOT mechanical!  An ingenious and fool proof design of two opposing magnets creates the opening effect while the weight of the magnet closed the stopper.  Truly is machine washable and pretty durable."
3060,"I don't have much time.  I am a cat being held prisoner somewhere in Southern California.  The dog is watching, but he is easily fooled. I told him I'm playing the piano, he is a moron.  While I am not ""mistreated"" in the usual sense of the word, I must escape before I go mad.  The large, hairless two-legged creatures who hold me prisoner are well-meaning, I think, but so unevolved, they are almost to be pitied if I did not hate them so.<br /><br />They feed me this pasty food in a can. Me. Cat.  I am a hunter, a living weapon.  I crave blood, fresh warm meat between my teeth.  I yearn for crunchy bones filled with hot marrow.  Not Chicken and Tuna shreds in sauce. Last month I almost caught a moth. Ahh, the chase. First, my lethal approach...subtle yet as perilously accurate as an arrow.  Inch by inch I crept up to my prey, every muscle alive, every sense at it's peak, yet as silent as death.  The juicy moth just sat there, never sensing my presence.  I came close, very close, paused and then -- I pounced!  If the fools had a shorter table I would never have overshot the mark and hit the wall.  Damn them forever.  My ear, my beautiful ear...a precision instrument and objet d'art all in one, was bent.  Yes, bent.<br /><br />And what did the two legs do? They punished ME. Yes, As punishment I was taken to a place called The Vet, where other two-legged monsters did unspeakable things like shaving my beautiful fur and putting strips of white fabric over my beautiful head. Then they forced a megaphone over my head.  This trip was far less horrifying than my last visit, however.  You wouldn't believe what they did to me. You Would Not Believe It.  I can hardly believe it myself except when I look down and...well, never mind, but it's worse than you could ever imagine. Ever.<br /><br />Finally The Vet creatures returned me to my captors...but they would not remove The Cone of Humiliation from off my head.  ""Two more weeks, Beebo, you need to wear it for two more weeks and then you'll be fine, azza bwave Beebo, bwave bwave boy.""  That's the sentence they handed down.  The Cone of Humiliation is designed to break me.  It will not, even though the dog now laughs at me.  At ME.<br /><br />Let him laugh.  I have plans for him.  Yes indeedy. I have plans.<br /><br />The Two-Legs call me Beebo.  ""Izzee my baby Beebo. Izze wanna skwatchie skwatchie ittle Beebo, come to Mommy, Mommy wuv Beebo"" they say. To Me. Me, the Warrior King.  I am not a cocker spaniel.  I am a living weapon, a Cat.  Were it not for the ear-scratching, head-scratching, special pillow near the fireplace and opportunities to torment the dog, I would dispose of the two-leggers and escape.  I do not wish to harm two such well-meaning but stupid creatures, but I must have meat.  I would eat the dog, but I've seen what he eats, and quite frankly, I'm appalled.<br /><br />Please, if anyone is out there, help me.  Send meat...a box of mice...fat and juicy ones...would make a life of captivity almost livable.  Also, since you are putting the package together, I could do with another Feather on a String, two boxes of Fishy Treatz (not the liver, mind you), oh, and one more thing...a chicken bone. A nice, easily-shattered, sharp edged chicken bone...with a nice little piece of bacon to wrap it in. A gift for a friend, shall we say...<br /><br />Act fast. Please."
3061,$21 / 5 = $4.20<br />When I buy the jars individually at the grocery store (QFC in Seattle) I pay around $3.60 per jar.  How is this a good deal?<br /><br />UPDATE (March 2011): at the discounted price of $17.42 for the 5-pack it's $3.48 for each jar. QFC in Seattle now sells the 13oz jar for $3.99. Now we're talking :)
3062,"This was the miso base I used for my first attempt at home-made miso soup.  I used instant hon-dashi, tofu, and wakame as well.  It wasn't bad.  I'd certainly buy the base again, though my tastebuds prefer something a little saltier.  (Keep in mind, though... I added a pinch of salt to my own bowl and it suited me just fine.  And, the instant dashi could be making a difference as opposed to how the miso would have turned out had I made it by scratch.)<br /><br />Give it a go.  :)  The best thing is that one package by itself would make several servings.  12.1oz container, using 1-2tbs of miso per pot... you get the idea."
3063,"I started using Manuka Honey to see if I could finally get off Prilosec that I have been taking everyday for 8-9 months now for acid reflux.  Everytime I would stop taking it the heartburn would come back within 24 hours.  It didn't matter what I ate it would just come back, so I tried Manuka Honey (1 teaspoon in the morning) .  I have been Prilosec free for 2 weeks now and the only other thing I do is take a table spoon of a fiber supplement (Citrucel) also in the morning. I have been taking Manuka honey for about 1 1/2 months.  No heartburn, no pills for 2 weeks now and I eat whatever the hell I want.  Coincidence? Hum......."
3064,I tried the lobster mac n cheese. It was horrible. There was hardly any lobster in the mac n cheese. The reviews said there were big chunks. Also I got bad ndigestion.
3065,Lentils in a big bag. It came with no cooking directions or suggestions and when I emailed them the response was blah!<br />I didn't see the great customer service they bragged about. It must not be there.
3066,"This is the first time I have tried an organic maple syrup.  Being a Grade A Dark Amber already promised great taste, but being organic added to the expectations.  The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes."
3067,"IN A NUTSHELL: FEW NATURAL FOODS COULD BE WORSE FOR YOU THAN LARD!<br /><br />WHAT IS WORSE?  --- Hydrogenated LARD, which is loaded with TRANS FATTY ACIDS - CHOLESTEROL - SATURATED FAT - AGRICULTURAL CHEMICALS - HORMONES ETC. AND that's what this product is.<br /><br />SOME INTERESTING STUFF: WHERE IS THE LARD ON THEIR WEBSITE?<br /><br />Dial, the soap people, own Armour, and Armour makes this Hydrogenated, ""All Natural"" Lard. However, though Armour owns up to making many less than healthy edibles, on their website, there is NO mention of Lard as one of their many products.<br /><br />If you have to use Lard, this is a long established brand that resturants use, and though ""hydrogenated"", this is a good product as hydrogenated Lard goes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I wince when I leave a resturant, and while walking through their parking lot find myself staring at huge tubs of empty lard containers lying around the dumpsters. Funny, but I'd swear they weren't there before I ate.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is not just lard, but Hydrogenated Lard, which should be stricken from the human diet if at all possible. If that is not possible, Armour has been a reliable brand that has been making lard forever, though they don't want to admit it apparently [WONDER WHY?].<br /><br />It does, however, make me wonder what is in Dial soap?!<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]"
3068,"I LOVE THE SMELL TASTE FEEL OF COFFEE ! However as a health issue i dropped all caffiene including my beloved coffee. Oh the Pain. Several months later i was on a trip and was served ROASTAROMA and it was amazing. Full bodied and rich like coffee without caffiene and not that horrible taste of decafe coffees. I couldnt find it anywhere and checked Celestial's web site and learned there wasnt ONE store within 25 miles that carried Roastaroma ..hence my purchase from Amazon. If you dont want the caffiene, and love the rich smell and taste of coffee...without that decafe taste.....this is the drink for you."
3069,"Description of the product says: ""Soursop Leaves Tea"". Actually, I have received a small bag (about 1/2 once) of Soursop Leaves not the TEA. Besides that, the quality of the leaves is marginal - they were not dried properly and look and smell similar to brownish autumn leaves in the late autumn forest. And to make it all just a bit better: the bag contains in addition to the bad dried leaves - small particles of grass and herbs dust. Now you got the picture - if it describes the product you are willing to brew a tea from - go ahead and order, otherwise STAY AWAY!"
3070,"So here's how it went down.<br /><br />My teenage sons crowd around with innocent curiosity as I take the mammoth 5-pound bag out of the cardboard box, the box with the beguiling Amazon smile on the side. That knowing, wicked Cheshire grin. Within seconds the bag is neatly cut open. An oddly hypnotic aroma wafts out.<br /><br />It begins.<br /><br />We all sample one or two of the pleasantly rubbery candies, but find ourselves exchanging the same puzzled expression: that flavor---not really cola...vaguely medicinal, yet not offensive. Hmm. Further testing is required.<br /><br />We all sit down. Sampling continues now in earnest---they're so small! Where's the harm?---and we agree that you need to eat quite a few to identify the flavor with any accuracy. Not a name brand cola, to be sure...one of those ""store brands,"" after it's gone flat. We notice that after the first 50 or so, the flavor seems to change somewhat, perhaps because all our teeth are now caked with adherent masses of gummy residue. Our mood is high, so testing continues.<br /><br />General consensus is reached after the first pound or two that the bottles in the middle of the mass are softer and more fragrant than the stuff from the top of the bag. The bag is passed around, sniffing ensues. Great effort is expended seeing how far a bottle can be stretched, while held between the front teeth, until it breaks.<br /><br />The unmistakable signs of hyperglycemia ---exhilaration, rapid speech, a cola-like aroma on the breath---go somewhat unnoticed as we burrow deeper into the jiggly wad of gummies. Dinner is postponed along with homework. A telephone call from my ex-wife goes unanswered. The scientific process cannot be interrupted. Would Fermi have taken time out from inventing the x-ray deathgun to take a call from his ex-wife? Please.<br /><br />The fun almost stops when a bottle goes up a nostril ---kids!--- but everything is soon back on track when we discover that moistened bottles can be stuck to the forehead for minutes at a time. Soon my sons' faces bristle with the things. A joke is made about ""edible lesions"". Hilarity ensues. Photos are taken. Outside it grows dark while leaves blow about, unraked. The scratching of a pet at the door stopped some time ago.<br /><br />Bottles are eaten ten at a time now. Cola-stained spittle dribbles down a chin. No time to wipe. Got to keep chewing. They are SO VERY SMALL.<br /><br />Suddenly the bag is empty.<br /><br />Empty. The room goes quiet.  The box is re-examined, but no stray gummies are found. The box with the grin. That damn, mocking grin. I have to explain to the children why I only ordered one 5-pound bag. We all feel somewhat sick. We are all trembling now.<br /><br />Parents, sometimes single dads cannot be trusted to make good judgments about their kids' eating habits. Living with the stress of alimony can pervert that part of the mind which regulates dietary choices, or common sense.<br /><br />I hope this will serve as a valuable object lesson for you all."
3071,"Attracted by the packaging, I purchased a bag [of the Classic Sea Salt flavor] in a local 'gourmet market'.  At 110 calories, I suspected that I had been, as frequently happens, fooled by the 'serving size' (you know how it goes, 2.5 pieces = a 'serving' - so there are actually 7 'servings'/bag)  BUT, NO, what a pleasant surprise - 110 calories was for the WHOLE delicious bag!  They're non-greasy, light as a feather and unexpectedly filling - I almost couldn't finish the bag.  I noticed they were produced here in NY, which I also liked and, after going online to find out more about them, decided to splurge for a case [of 1 oz. bags] to try all the varieties.<br /><br />One ounce doesn't sound like very much but they are so light that it is actually a very full bag and definitely more than enough for a single serving.  (The 3 oz. bag contains substantially more then you would want for just one person)<br /><br />Favorites so far are:<br />Honey Mustard & Onion<br />Vintage Cheese<br />Classic Sea Salt<br /><br />I don't have kids but I expect these would work extremely well as a lunch box addition.<br /><br />My only suggestion to the company would be that it might be a good idea if they made them available for purchase in smaller quantities.  I'm afraid many people will be put off by having to purchase in 12- & 24-bag sized cases.<br /><br />But, if you do decide to purchase, I also have no doubt that you'll have no trouble sharing them with friends and will probably be back for more sooner than you expected."
3072,I think they would have been good... really wish I could have experienced them.  They've never arrived.
3073,"I have tried a number of Ghee brands, and hands-down this is my favorite.  It tastes just like you melted your own butter and removed the froth from the top.  Luscious.  I use it to make eggs, and to saute vegetables.  It has never burned or oxidized during even very high heat browning.  Another benefit is that the makers only use grass-fed cows to make this ghee.  I'm totally hooked."
3074,My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.
3075,"This is really a great way to have breakfast at your office or practically anywhere.  However, they don't give you an equal distribution of the various cereals.  Here is the breakdown (from the side of the box):<br /><br />16: 2.1oz Frosted Flakes<br /><br />8 : 1.5oz Froot Loops<br /><br />12: 2.8oz Rasin Bran Crunch<br /><br />10: 1.5oz Apple Jacks<br /><br />10: 1.5oz Corn Pops<br /><br />4(!): Cocoa Rice Krispies<br /><br />The main reason I got this over using regular boxes was that I wanted a variety of different cereals.  However, there are way too many Frosted Flakes and far too few Rice Krispies.  Kind of takes the ""variety"" out of variety pack."
3076,"Excellent product, very yummy, my kids eat these like candy.... Just a caution though, if purchasing from the vitamin shoppe, they will only send you one bag, 8oz, claiming Amazon misprinted. You may think you are getting a great price only to find you paid an arm and a leg for a small amount!"
3077,"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA"">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend."
3078,"I have been suffering from a bloated stomach--looking like I was ready to deliver any minute--for going on 2 yr.  I have had MRIs and blow-in-the bag tests and gastric emptying tests and upper GIs and on and on and none showed a reason for the bloating.  Even had my gallbladder out since everyone (me too) thought that was the fix, but the bloating remains long after the gall bladder is gone.  So here I was bloated like a pig with pressure and pain and general misery, searching for yet another solution. Doctor had none. I ordered the fennel tea thinking yeah, sure, but what the heck--a total skeptic.  It arrived this morning. By the time I finished the first cup at least 70% of the bloating was gone, taking the pressure and pain with it. A couple of hours later I am practically ""normal."" So I am a believer (although I need to see if it continues to work) I am not good at putting things in my mouth that taste ""funny"" but this is not a bad taste at all (as in I didn't have to gag it down).  I am going to be excited to see if this really continues to work.  Right now I am thinking it is magical. Oh as an extra bonus--their customer support person was terrific, competent, kind, and American."
3079,"I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.  This chocolate has no flavor of bat in any way shape or form.  I did a review of the chocolate from the same company with the chimpanzee on the label, and noted no flavor of chimp in it.  I was forced to give it a one star review, but did try to be fair and say the chocolate itself, if it was sold as JUST chocolate was fine.  Now they continue this trend of such false labelling and have no bat flavor in this chocolate.  What gives?  Yes, as chocolate it's fine, much like the so called chimpanzee flavored bar I tried earlier this year, so consider this a four or five star review if the lack of bat flavor doesn't bother you.  But doesn't a chocolate bar with let's say raspberries on the label contain a raspberry extract, jelly or something else with raspberry flavor?  Why wouldn't one with a bat on the label contain no bat flavor?  I may try the other chocolates by this company, I'm curious to see if the one with the panther on the label does taste at least like some sort of cat, if not an actual panther.  But I am disappointed yet again by this company.  If you're going to claim to flavor your chocolate to taste like animals, include the animal flavor!"
3080,"I have never written a review before but feel I must based on the terrible quality of this product. Before trying it, it smelled and looked fine. The nutritional profile is very good-protein, fiber, carbs, calories-but the taste is horrendous. I am personally content with bland foods, odd flavors and eat an almost sugar free diet. But when this stuff hits your mouth, the taste resembles that of soil mixed with feces. I mixed 2 tablespoons (half the serving size) with 4oz unsweetened almond milk and on the first sip I uncontrollably gagged. I immediately added a whole packet of stevia and that still didn't sufficiently mask the taste. It is completely obvious that the manufacturer spent all the money on finding a way to isolate the protein and absolutely NONE on taste, or taste testing.<br />Based on another review, I purchased Living Harvest. It is super delicious! It does have sugar in it, but not much. There's only 7 grams. The protein content is only 10 grams, but it's edible-which is more than I can say for Manitoba. I tried mixing the Manitoba with the Living Harvest, but it instantly turned it un-palatable."
3081,"These tablets are the best brand I have tried so far, and they work very well. THe tablet itself does not taste so bad, and the effects last about a half hour with constant eating probably longer if you are not eating as much. I definitely recommend cutting up your food beforehand... or while you are waiting for the pill to dissolve (it takes about 7 minutes). Of the four people who I had try this, all of them felt very profound effects. Some recommendations:<br />>Oranges (my favorite)<br />>Lemons<br />>Mix lemon juice and water, it tastes like really good lemonade.<br />>Limes (still pretty sour, but still delicious).<br />>Grapefruit (NOT white grapefruit). This tastes like sex.<br />>Apple Cider Vinegar (Just a sip, it is still very strong, but it is worth trying it).<br />>(Mangoes Do NOT work very well)<br />>Lemon Juice tastes really good, still slightly sour but like a lemon drop candy.Put. It. On. Everything. EVERYTHING.<br /><br />Warning: Eating tons of citrus in a short period of time may give you a stomach ache, acid reflux, the runs, or death. It is totally worth it."
3082,"I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it."
3083,"Well, Aerogrow is sending me another unit.  They have already taken the trouble to send me a replacement bowl which fixed the first problem and later, they sent a replacement pump which shut down the entire system.  I don't like contacting them and then getting replacements.  My aerogrow setup does not look like the flourishing results at the local kitchenwares store.  My consumer experience thus far has stank despite customer service's efforts to fix the problems.  Customer service has remained courteous and attentive.  They have mailed out parts promptly but does that buy them my silence?  Well, I can see how the positive reviews are true on this site so make up your mind after reading all of them.  Mine is just one experience. I lost money and I lost time and will start all over again once I receive the new unit.  If I had ordered through amazon, I would have just returned it for a money refund.  So if you want to try hydroponic growing as I did, then go ahead and buy this but I urge you to buy from amazon.  Good luck.<br /><br />Here were my issues that were all responded to by aerogrow's customer service:<br /><br />(1) I was misled that by ordering directly from aerogrow instead of Amazon at the cost of Amazon's free shipping, I would become a special customer and receive discounts on future purchases on seeds and more machines. But when I wrote to aerogrow about not receiving any membership packet, I was told that the additional purchases should be made at the time of the initial purchase (when I have no experience with the worthiness of the aerogrow product)<br /><br />(2) aerogrow had to send me a new bowl because when I received the product the red indicator light for low water level was already on and NEVER shut off.  Following the suggestions from the phone rep did not solve the problem at all. The new bowl fixed the problem.<br /><br />(3)  Then I realized that deep in the growing period a number of herbs were not growing at all and was told that I had received a bad pump and would have to install a new one that Aerogrow would be sending me and that I would have to start all over again from the beginning with another packet of herbs that would be included in the package.<br /><br />(4) I unplugged the aerogrow and installed the pump according to the BLURRY pictures on the instruction sheet and now the entire machine will not turn on.  Changing the pump is messy and not recommended. Don't throw away the attaching screw for the old pump because Aerogrow doesn't give you anything but the pump and the blurry instructions.<br /><br />The remaining survivors are going to die but that's okay because I have a brand new packet of seeds and in two months, I MIGHT have herbs, right?<br /><br />(5) I put the new plug in today and now the machine won't turn on at all.  HELP!<br /><br />This product just isn't reliable and it is priced too high to be this risky.<br /><br />(6) Aerogrow reps always maintained a friendly tone and polite demeanor in dealing with me. However, I still felt wronged. When the replacement never showed up after weeks, I emailed requesting a full refund, offering to ship the machine back to them so they could investigate the problem. They said that I could chuck the old machine, the new one was at the post office because of a wrong address and that they would credit my credit card. I have to check to see if they did. I don't want another aerogrow anyway."
3084,"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

3085,"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again. As noted the claims of ""no nitrites"" in the description are false: Beef, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy protein, Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed and Soy Oil, Caramel Color), Water, Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein (Hydrolyzed Soy and Corn Protein, Salt with Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed, Soybean) added), Dehydrated Garlic, Black Pepper, Curing Salt (Salt, Sodium Nitrite).

3086,"Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky."
3087,"This tea is really really good!  It's worth drinking for the taste alone!  I started drinking this tea when my baby was only eight weeks old and my milk supply already started to dry up.  I also recommend taking fenugreek and milk thistle with this product (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RH67GE"">Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams</a>).  I drank the tea by itself for the first week but then panicked when my milk supply only slightly increased.  I don't think there is quite enough fenugreek in this tea because I added the fenugreek and milk thistle after it being recommended to me and literally the next day my milk supply was back in full force.  Did I say the tea tastes great, always a plus!"
3088,"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.<br /><br />I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier."
3089,"Even though I am a vegetarian, this was my first time buying nutritional yeast.  I recommend that anyone considering this for their child should get a sample or smaller package first.  I have been searching for milk alternatives for my son since discovering he has an allergy to milk.  He is fine with all types of soy cheeses so far and I thought this would be a good alternative to soy.<br />I have tried preparing him 'mac n' cheese' twice- once using the recipe on the bag and once trying my own recipe and both times my four year old said 'yuck, is this a special type of cheese?'. My 2 year old seems to be OK with it, but I think it upset her belly.<br />I am very satisfied with the quality and taste of this product and I am happy to have the extra B vitamins in my diet.  I think it does upset my stomach slightly, but I am not completely positive about that.<br />Unfortunately, I might find it difficult to work my way through 4 bags that I had bought to share with my son.  I found the taste to be pleasant, a little bit like cheese, but there is also a slight off-taste to it that children might not like. The best I can describe it is slightly bitter, or earthy. Which is fine, but just don't expect your child to love it like I did after reading all the positive reviews."
3090,"Is this cheap, ""Heck, no.""<br /><br />Is this good, ""Yes!""<br /><br />Pu-erhs (ooo-air)are made into little (or big) cakes of tea, and then allowed to ferment (rot).  Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are ""double-fermented"".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup."
3091,"Despite claims to the contrary, hemp protein is not a complete protein.  It is very weak in lysine, and doesn't have enough leucine and tryptophan.  Because of this, if you eat it in large quantities, especially in a vegetarian diet, it cannot count gram for gram. That is not to say it is not a very positive element of a well balanced diet in reasonable diet proportions or when complementary proteins balance the weaknesses.  One tip: Protein from almonds and almond milk are also just as incomplete in lysine.<br /><br />Hemp seed protein has all essential amino acids - just not in the optimal proportions.  You'd be hard pressed to find any protein that was nearly devoid of even one of them (ok, gelatin is a rare contender). ... it is good to separate the hype in the marketing of nutritional supplements and then to enjoy it for what it offers ;-)<br /><br />According to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer of this natural hemp 50% protein powder, provides on THEIR website - put in terms of proportions of each of the essential amino acids per actual gram of the hemp protein, this is NOT complete protein by definition.<br /><br />The standard ""complete protein"" definition you can find on Wikipedia defined, or on the Self (Nutrition) site is, in mg per gram overall protein:<br /><br />Tryptophan................7<br />Threonine................27<br />Isoleucine...............25<br />Leucine..................55<br />Lysine...................51<br />Methionine+Cystine.......25<br />Phenylalanine+Tyrosine...47<br />Valine...................32<br />Histidine................18<br /><br />Hemp: Lysine is only 27/51: incomplete.<br /><br />If you look at the essential aa's stated on the Nutiva website and compared them to the definition of a complete protein above you will notably find less than 55% of the complete proportion of lysine.  Tryptophan and BCAA leucine are also coming up short: three of the nine essential amino acids are thus lacking vs. a ""complete protein"". That gives hemp seed protein quality score of under 55 when a complete protein needs to be 100 or more. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well. But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers. In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy. That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />The bioavailability of hemp protein is decent - somewhere around 80% bioavailability - typical for veggies which presents a challenge. Compared to milk, egg or chicken, for example, these score in the high 90's for bioavailability in digestion (flavor and whether it agrees with you are different concepts). In perspective, and unfortunately, that makes hemp's protein quality worse than the approximate 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said hemp can be GREAT if balanced properly in the diet! You just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs, when you use the supplements as a major portion of your diet.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively ""low protein quality"" with other ""low quality"" or otherwise complementary proteins (don't get misled by the use of the word quality ... all protein is good ... we are just looking to meet optimal human requirements and that is where the misnomer 'quality' is being applied).<br /><br />To get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add at some point in the day, (this works) 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route. Alternately, adding a reasonable amount of yogurt for its protein content works fine, and if you eat fish, cod is one of the best complements to hemp as it has a lysine score of about 180 vs. hemp's 55.<br /><br />""Eat a well balanced diet"". Yogurt or whey protein in your diet will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy since that is controversial and certainly for people who have low thyroid hormone levels... find soy extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the hormones in soy (which many tout as 'good') are diminished during the alcohol extraction.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better ""quality"" than hemp if you look at it alone, but properly part of a balanced diet, neither is better than the other.<br /><br />Believe it or not, eating too much protein can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out. This applies especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins (which are close to optimal individually eaten). Excess amino acids in a diet are disposed of by putting the liver to work. In extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver), you will get a yellower urine even when you drink lots. That is basically the nitrogen byproduct after the body burns and stores the protein it cannot use. So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted nitrogen and the rest converted into energy or stored as glycogen or fat - there is no memory or ""protein reserve"" in the body. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about. All these consideration are for extreme cases. In healthy cases where hemp is part of a balanced diet it is a non-issue.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. Alternately you can spend a mint on amino acid supplement pills to raise the hemp to a ""higher"" quality protein than soy or whey for that matter ...<br /><br />People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality can become major issues for them. Like to preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation."

3093,"I was a Blue Buffalo advocate from day one when I purchased it for my dog.  The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find).  I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product.  This was before I had to deal with their customer service department.  On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag.  I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year.  On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date.  Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates?  In my Petsmart, Blue Buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week.  How is this my responsibility?  They kept sending harassing e-mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high-quality brand sit there expired for almost a year.  I have since switched my dog to Evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it.  I'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because I truly believed in their product.  The only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal."
3094,"You can't fully appreciate the packaged frozen hot chocolate until you've had the REAL frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3 in NYC. While it doesn't come close to the homemade kind you get there, it's a GREAT alternative for when you're really craving some or you miss it or you're just far away and can't have it, etc. It's all about adding your personal touch with the ice, maybe some whipped cream and cocoa shavings like they do at the restaurant. So no, it's not the chocolate dessert to end all chocolate desserts, because that's the ORIGINAL frozne hot chocolate, but this is a delicious, inexpensive, fast, substitute and makes a fabulous gift when paired with a mug or other coffee/sweet goodies. So that's the point, it's not to replace the original, it's just to satisfy some cravings, so if you've never had the original it might not be the best thing in the world to you but after you've had the original you'll find these packets will satisfy many, many cravings taht will follow! Hope that helps!  --Fellow chocolate love and frozen hot chocolate expert!"

3096,"I love the flavor of these dark chocolate crispy wafers! I love the flavor so much, that I often will drink a cup of coffee and savor one or two of these treats when I need a quick pick me up.  Sometimes I break off a small bite-size piece of cookie and place it in my mouth, then quickly sip my hot coffee, allowing the wafer to melt, and the two flavors to meld into a lovely mocha blend.<br /><br />This morning I was aghast at finding tiny intruders ruining my mid-morning break.  Granted, these interlopers did not willingly join me in my private tasting, they had died long (?) ago during the baking process of these Famous Chocolate Wafers.  This morning, not only did I encounter the lovely mocha blend flavor on my tongue, but also small chunks of what I initially thought might be coconut.  IT WAS NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />What I encountered was larvae (about 1/8"" in length, light yellowish brown)as well as full-size bodies of the adult bugs (also about 1/8"" long)and husk-like fiber --- none of these are easily confused with coconut. I couldn't believe my eyes (or tongue), so I took an intact wafer from the box, placed it on a saucer, and melted it in a small amount of tap water.  Again I made the same startling discovery -- GROSS -- and immediately called the phone number on the box.<br /><br />I requested that someone follow-up with me to report the findings, but apparently, Nabisco/Kraft does not wish to be held accountable to its customers when dissatisfaction occurs. So BEWARE . . ."
3097,"There is a lot of controversy surrounding this dietary supplement. The manufacturer claims that their product is the next best thing to eating fruits and vegetables, and that it picks its fruit and veggies at their peak ripeness, and then they use a proprietary process to reduce them to a powder containing much of the original vitamins and nutrients, while maintaining high bio-availability (which means that your body is able to use and take advantage of the nutrients instead of excreting most of it as waste).<br /><br />Many scientific studies, however, claim to disprove, or have produced conflicting results to, many of the manufacturer's claims about the product (see the ""Product Research"" section on Juice Plus' Wikipedia page: [...]. It doesn't help that the main product distribution process is through the use of multi-level marketing (aka pyramid scheme), and that many reviewers/commenters giving it 5 stars are also re-sellers of this product who always seem to want to send you to their personal website for more information about the product. FYI: I, personally, have not, do not, and do not plan to sell Juice Plus+.<br /><br />Before I knew any of this information, though, our Lamaze coach recommended it as a convenient way for my pregnant wife to make sure that the fetus (and my wife) would get as many vital nutrients as possible. Of course, nothing compares to eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but it's not always possible to eat as many as JuicePlus claims to contain.<br /><br />I have personally used Juice Plus off and on over the past couple years, and I've found that, when I take it regularly for a couple weeks (morning and night, not all 4 capsules at once), most of the tension in my neck and shoulders disappears, which is amazing. So, what's the main catch? At just over $160 for a 4-month supply (per person), it's not exactly a purchase you shrug off. Until I'm able to find something that is as natural, convenient, and doesn't have all kinds of crazy side-effects, though, I'm sticking with Juice Plus.<br /><br />EDIT - 09-13-2012: So I've taken a lot of heat (and have even been personally attacked in the comments) for referencing Wikipedia information from a couple years ago that indicated that JuicePlus distributors worked under a multi-level marketing arrangement, which functions similarly to a pyramid scheme, but is completely legal. The Wikipedia article has since been amended, and now states: ""Juice Plus products are marketed by individual distributors who receive sales commissions ranging from 6% (for enrolling five customers in 30 days) to 14% (for enrolling twenty customers in 30 days).""<br /><br />I also made reference to the many studies that tout the benefits of this product, and that many of the claims in these studies are ""disputed by consumer watchdog organizations and governmental agencies as misleading"". If you read the comments attached to this review (and my other, almost identical, JuicePlus review), you'll see that these studies are defended in the comments here (most likely by JuicePlus distributors) with almost cult-like enthusiasm. However, here is an interesting tidbit from Wikipedia in regards to these myriad ""independent"" studies. Discuss: ""Of the published peer-reviewed studies on Juice Plus products, the majority were funded and/or authored by the manufacturer, Natural Alternatives International (NAI) or the main distributor, NSA. two were funded by individual Juice Plus distributors; and one was conducted independently.""<br /><br />My review above praises the product for reducing tension in my neck and shoulders, but I feel as if I'm paying too much for this benefit. Wikipedia backs this up, referencing studies by the University of Berkley, as well as the Center For Science In The Public Interest, stating ""it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects can be attributed to the inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits.""<br /><br />I mentioned that I had not yet been able to find an inexpensive alternative to JuicePlus that offered the same benefits without any negative effects. However, for the past few months, I've discontinued JuicePlus, and have instead tried a product called JuiceFestiv (available through Amazon, Costco, and other retailers), which is similar to JuicePlus in that it contains powdered fruits and veggies in separate capsules. I've determined that JuiceFestiv offers similar benefits to JuicePlus, but at about 1/2 to 1/4 the cost (I've found the best savings when purchased on sale at Costco). That's right, you can get a 2-month supply of JuiceFestiv for $20 compared to a 1-month supply of JuicePlus for $40.<br /><br />I feel that it's important to take care of your body - you only get one - and that carefully researching and trying different natural supplements is a wise investment of your time and money. In this case, MY OPINION (which is backed up by research) is that JuicePlus is overpriced for the benefits it offers. I encourage everyone to try both JuicePlus and JuiceFestiv for themselves; compare the benefits your body receives, and compare the cost per benefit. You may find differences - nobody's physiology is exactly the same - but it's our differences (even of opinion) that make the world go 'round, right? :)"
3098,"I love this film.  Barbara and Adam Maitland, a young couple madly in love (played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) discover that they are not only dead but trapped in their home as ghosts waiting for the bureaucracy of the afterlife to set them free.  When a New York couple (Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones) and their teenage daughter Lydia (wonderfully macabre Winona Ryder) move into their beloved house, the Maitlands want nothing more than to remove them.  The problem is, the Maitlands are too nice to truly scare anyone.  They meet a rogue ghost, the ribald, disgusting Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) who promises to drive the family away, with a few strings attached.  Lydia, whose goals aren't that far from the Maitlands and who has a morbid, poignantly sad outlook, discovers the ghosts and tries to help them.  But Beetlejuice has his own agenda.<br /><br />The casting for this movie is perfect, with only Alec Baldwin's performance less than memorable.  Michael Keaton is suitably slimy and decadent, while Geena Davis plays the earnest innocence of her character equally well.  The most startling performance is a young Winona Ryder, who shows tremendous range in her role as the morbid but good-hearted Lydia.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious, dark scenes ever filmed is contained in this movie, when the New York couple throws a pretentious dinner party and the Maitlands take over. Director Tim Burton uses sight gags, situational comedy, and one-liners that all bear his trademark quirkiness to make this film inventive and, even years after its release, fresh.  What's most amazing in this film essentially about the weirdness of being dead is the emotional drive of it.  The Maitlands' yearning to reclaim their home even in death and Lydia's wounded, lonely adolescence lend humanity to an otherwise wild comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this off-beat film for its hilarity and irreverence.  Parents of young children should be warned that the film contains off-color humor as well as images and ideas that might disturb young minds. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
3099,"I love Torani Syrup and these flavors are great! Made with cane sugar, not corn syrup, which is a huge plus. Taste great in hot chocolate, herbal tea and steamed milk. Great for Italian sodas too.<br /><br />However, the product description says absolutely nothing about the fact that these bottles are plastic and not glass bottles that Torani Syrup is usually packaged in. The plastic bottles don't have as long of a shelf life (2 years compared to 3 years for the glass bottles). The plastic that they are made with (PET) has not been proven to be safe. I don't like the idea of chemicals (antimony and phthalates) leaking into the syrup over a long period of time because it's going to take a while to use up all of the syrup. I can't return these because they are a grocery item."
3100,"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE."
3101,"If you have missed the ease and familiar taste of a boxed brownie mix try these!  Betty Crocker's GF brownies are an amazingly close contender to their original brownies.  They smell the same, look the same, and taste pretty darn close.  It was lovely to add butter and eggs and have yummy familiar brownies in under a half an hour. We are thrilled that a major brand has jumped on the gluten free band wagon, we hope many more companies follow!"
3102,"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
3103,"My kids hated the natural peanut butters that I used to buy and I hated to use the ones that had hydrogenated oils in them. Kudos to Skippy for developing this. This stuff spreads like the other ones, tastes like the other ones and costs about the same (if you can find it). And it doesn't separate. My kids love it and so do I."
3104,"I can only add three things to what others have already said - the aroma of this rice mix will fill your home and you will love it.  Comparied to plain brown rice that I buy at the store (Mahatma) this mix has three times the fiber per serving.  And lastly the cooking directions on my bag differ slightly from the directions here at Amazon - the bag does not say to rinse first (so I don't), and the bag says to cover AFTER you have brought to a boil and reduced the heat.  Other than these comments I can only agree whole-heartedly with the first five reviews, that this totally wholesome food item is scrumpdiddlyumscious."
3105,"We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6"">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!"
3106,"I have had a keurig for over 4 years.  Never have I had grounds in my coffee until I bought a fifty pack of Jet fuel.  As I work my way through the box, I am throwing out about every third cup.  I ""believe"" the problem is a thinner than usual foil top, a larger hole is created, during the punch,  and the water is not regulated at the same percentage.  I called to talk to ""the coffee people"", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.  I am done with jet fuel and coffee people, Timothy's  - you have my k-cup money!"
3107,I bought this for the nutritional benefits but so far my results have been failures. It's tasty but as with whole wheat flour I prefer the taste of regular flour.<br /><br />I finally made the teff peanut butter cookie recipe and they turned out like a flat crunchy cracker but I improved the second tray by adding marmalade and cinnamon for a surprisingly Chinese flavor.
3108,"I considered buying these in bulk here on Amazon, then realized that i would be over paying! The very same bars are $3 for a box of 8... to get 48 bars, would would be spending $18, instead of $22+ (shipping, tax, etc). Plus, then i can choose the variety of flavors we want, not what is pre-boxed. While some of the bulk items here are a deal, many are not!"
3109,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 5:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>This is the way I've had luck using this type of trap. I've killed over 35 moles from my yard this way but keep in mind that techniques may vary depending on your area and soil type."
3110,"At first glance it may seem that this product is somewhat expensive--$30+ for tea, right? But a pound of green tea powder is A LOT!!! For a 6 oz cup of tea or most other uses you only need to use about a half a teaspoon or things get a little strong and murky. But I add it to everything--my morning protein shake, yogurt, Gatorade for the gym, etc., etc. and still I have yet to make a dent in the bag. I have also looked at green tea powder at places like Whole Foods and Asian super markets, and this is a really good deal in comparison. So buy some and enjoy!"
3111,"I use this on my face in the evening.  At first it seems really greasy, but after about 5 minutes it totally soaks in - doesn't leave any residue/stains on my pillowcase.  I also use it on my lips.  Definitely recommend :)"
3112,"Some quality gourmet food items in here, with a nice presentation.  An early holiday gift in a brown box with the cover sheet like a gift wrap.  Priced just right, and delivered earlier than expected.  I'll be buying this again, and again."
3113,"I'm a total ZICO loyalist and buy at least 6 liters a week. I decided to purchase from Amazon since they deliver and those bottles are heavy to shelp up my stairs. I would give this 5 stars but 3 out of my 6 bottles had cap defects. The caps were starting to separate from the bottle which resulted in leakage and possible contamination.<br /><br />I've seen this in grocery stores as well, so I know it's not an ""Amazon"" issue. :(<br /><br />I notified Zico online- I guess we will see what happens.<br /><br />On a unrelated note.. Amazon you should have a spell check option within the review section..."
3114,I've been taking this for about 6 weeks and it really seems to keep me on a even keel.  I've also lost weight on it without really trying.  Will be ordering more soon.  My doctor says if it works to stay with it.  She has done the research on saffron and is really impressed so far.
3115,"Yeah. Toothpicks. For $7 no less. What a bargain!!! And they are flavored? No way. That's so cool. Why didn't anyone think of this - well besides Joe in Middle School - with flavoring for next to nothing. But still, a seven dollar tooth pick is my idea of fun. And even better - if you get sick of them you can sell them on ebay as pieces of the crucifix that Jesus was hanged on (or the guy that played him in The Passion)"
3116,"I got the Beaba Babycook as a gift, and adored it for several weeks. I work and have very little spare time to spend in the kitchen, so I loved being able to steam and puree my baby's food without having to clean multiple pots and pans. Then, after about a month of regular use, I noticed a foul odor coming from the well where the water goes. I looked inside and saw that a brown crust had formed there. I figured it must be lime deposit that had turned brown from being exposed to the hot temperature of the babycook, but when I tried to descale the well, the vinegar did almost nothing to remove the brown deposit, even after several attempts. I was also very worried to see that the water that ended up in the steamer basket was brown, thus suggesting that if I tried steaming more veggies, the deposit would end up in my baby's food.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer, and they recommended using distilled water (although there was no mention of this in the manual). So, I exchanged my now completely dysfunctional Babycook for a new one, and tried again. Within two days the brown film had developed, even though I was using distilled water. I don't know much about appliance design, but I figure there must be something really wrong with this gadget if it takes only a few days for such a deposit to form. And the odor is truly foul - no way I want my baby's food within a foot of whatever it is that collects there.<br /><br />I don't see any mention of this problem in other reviews, but at the same time, I can't imagine that I am the only person this has happened to, given that it happened TWICE to me. Too bad - I really loved the idea behind this product!"
3117,"This is a great product when used for what it was intended. It is not made to use as fresh sour cream on potatoes and the like. It is intended for baking or recipes like dips. It does not mix well straight into water, you add it with the powdered or dry part of your recipe and add the water with your other wet ingredients. I love powdered products and sour cream powder is a real convenience when you are out and need it."
3118,I didn't know what I was ordering and I have thrown it ALL away.  It tastes like brine.  No licorice taste at all. It was a large mistake
3119,"I have two little girls, ages 5 and 7, and for Easter this year, I decided that I wanted to get them a cute little bunny rabbit as a pet.  Well unfortunately for me, all the pet stores nearby were sold out, due to the popularity of rabbits at that time of year.  I had nearly given up on finding one, when I ran across this listing for fresh whole rabbits on amazon.com.  I wasn't sure what the first picture they showed was, but all the others were pictures of the kind of cute little bunny I wanted for my girls.  Maybe the first one was a rabbit just after it was born or something.  Seeing that the price was fairly reasonable, I ordered one.  I wasn't quite sure how they were going to get a live rabbit to me through the mail, but I figured ""hey, if anyone can do it, Amazon.com can"".<br /><br />When the package got to my house, I started to get a slight feeling that something wasn't right.  The box they had sent had no air-holes, and it was strangely cold to the touch.  But I figured that I didn't know anything about rabbits, so maybe that was normal.  Deciding to press on, I wrapped up the box and placed it under the Easter-tree in our living room (actually, it's just our old Christmas tree that I was too lazy to take out to the end of the driveway, but I won't tell if you don't).<br /><br />On Easter morning, my girls were up early, wanting to open their Easter present.  I sat on the couch, with my arm around my wife as they tore the paper off the package.  Eagerly awaiting their cries of happiness, I was startled when instead I heard screams of fear and horror.  The youngest was screaming that someone killed the Easter bunny, and the oldest barely made it to the bathroom in time to vomit.  As I looked in the box, expecting to see that maybe the poor rabbit had accidentally died, I saw instead, a rabbit carcass, gutted and skinned.<br /><br />Thinking that someone had played a horrible joke on our family, I immediately called Amazon.com to explain what had happened.  When I finally got done explaining our situation, the lady on the phone told me that the rabbits were supposed to be dead, they were meat rabbits, for eating.<br /><br />This is perhaps something that should be explicitly written in the description of the product on Amazon's website.  My daughters were incredibly traumatized by the situation, and are now undergoing counseling (at a rate of $200/hour) to help them deal with what they saw.  I shudder to think of what Easter will be like next year.<br /><br />So in short, it needs to be said in the product description that these rabbits are DEAD, and they are for eating.  Don't make the same mistake I did."
3120,"I was making a vegan ""mocha decadence"" cake for my bf and I needed a bunch of chocolate covered coffee beans for the recipe. I had a hard time finding them, it seemed like everywhere I found them, from World Market to Trader Joes, they contained milk and/or butter or some other dairy product. Finally I ended up ordering some with all vegan ingredients from nutsonline, and I should have used those but I messed up and left them at my boyfriend's house with no way to get them before I made the cake and only two days to find some new ones. So, I really needed to find something on Amazon and take advantage of Amazon Prime two day shipping.<br /><br />I was really excited to find these Crackheads, even though they do contain white chocolate coated beans as well as the dark chocolate, and even though I would rather have had a half or whole pound of beans all in one bag and not packed in individual small boxes. I figured I'd just pick out the white chocolate ones if I had enough, or otherwise just try the recipe with both.<br /><br />When the Crackheads arrived in the mail, I was really disappointed because I read the ingredients and what it says here on the website doesn't match what is on the box and these are not, in fact, vegan.<br /><br />Here is the actual ingredient list...<br /><br />Dark Chocolate (sugar, chocolate liquor (processed with potassium carbonate), cocoa butter, butter oil, lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla), white chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, nonfat milk, cream, natural flavor, soy lecithin (emulsifier), pure vanilla), fresh whole bean coffee, sugar, corn syrup, tapioca dextrin, confectioner's glaze."
3121,first off this company is a joke. they sell expired tea. look at the back of your tea and see how it is expried. mine was expired in 2003 I bought in 2007. stale to say the least. They are crooks and trying to make a fast buck off Japanese culture. I am insulted to say the least.<br /><br />I filed with amazon and reported them to the better business burough.<br /><br />Would you serve your kids a 5 year old bag of chips? how about a five year old box of mac and cheese? this stuff will make you sick!<br /><br />They are the rudest people around and DO NOT SUPPORT THEM!! if you have any respect for Japanese culture you will boycott this company!!!<br /><br />no way will what you get even look remotely what is in the picture! they are a non successful company selling trash!!! Old stock and instead of keeping fresh stock the peddle out olld stock at a high fresh price!!<br /><br />BOYCOTT THEM!!!
3122,"Nutella is stocked by the pallet in Europe, but much less popular in the USA for the excellent reason that the NJ plant produces an inferior product. This stuff is edible, but it's too sweet and doesn't have a strong hazelnut flavor. Ferrero finished Americanizing it by putting it in a much smaller plastic container and adding trans fat. Look for the genuine imported product or try making your own chocolate peanut butter. (I've tried making a chocolate hazelnut butter, but it's hard to duplicate the Nutella flavor)<br /><br />Update: Nutella now contains ""modified palm oil"" instead of the partially hydrogenated variety. It's nice of Ferrero to shell out the extra .03 per bottle not to use a substance known to be somewhat lethal, but I expect the flavor hasn't improved, or we'd all be hearing a lot more about it."
3123,"Oh my goodness... If all I ever used this in was smoothies, I'd still get my money's worth.  I never imagined I could drink a peanut butter smoothie without first packing my bags for a fat/calorie guilt trip!  In order to get this much peanut butter flavor you'd have to add a ton of peanut butter to even perceive it in there.  To the woman that said it was too pricey, I'd say that ONE peanut butter smoothie from Jamba Juice costs as much as a bag of this stuff.  I'm SO glad I found this product and can't wait to see what other yummy uses I can find for it.  The possibilities are endless!<br />Try this recipe:  1 cup non-dairy milk (soy or almond) 1 frozen banana, 1 tbsp PB2 or PB2 chocolate  Blend and enjoy."
3124,"Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."
3125,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!"
3126,"So, the title ""Fresh Whole Rabbit"" perplexes me a bit. If it was really ""Fresh"" as it is stated, wouldn't it still be alive? This takes the fun out of 'hunting for wabbits' with my collector's addition Elmer Fudd hat on. Instead, you take the thing out of the box and it just lies there. No amount of yelling or making loud noises will scare it away. I give this a two out of five. The fun factor is just non existent for me."

3129,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly."
3130,BUYING THIS ITEM WITH NO PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS LIKE SIGNING A BLANK CHECK.<br />ONLY A MORON WOULD DO THAT
3131,"Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People ""extra-bold trilogy""--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey.<br /><br />We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, ""Is that as dark as it gets??"" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S. You might look into <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM"">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a> as well. It was the first big hit for us, and still one of our faves."
3132,"I thought I'd tried this cereal years ago, but either the formula has changed or I'm thinking of something else. I was excited to see it on sale on line, but now I wish I'd never stocked up. I think I'm sending the rest to the food bank.<br /><br />I actually like the natural flavor of whole grains, but this is something made in a lab and you can tell. My first impression on my first bowl was ""wow, this is sure sickly sweet for a 'healthy' cereal"". I immediately checked the label for sugar content and was confused that there wasn't any, since the flavor is overly sweet and a bit nasty with it. I quickly noticed all the chemicals and food derivatives in the ingredient list, including aspartame as a sweetener. Ick."
3133,"I got this soup as a joke, but much to my surprise it really does taste exactly like cock!  Another great product by Grace."
3134,"This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull.  The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.  Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.  I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further.<br /><br />I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original."
3135,"Most of the reviews here seem to focus on the taste, versatility, and health benefits of this oil in cooking, but coconut oil does so much more than just taste great! With the 108 ounces of coconut-y goodness in this product, you'll have plenty to use all over the home.<br />Use it as:<br />* moisturizer, especially in harsh winters or if you suffer from eczema or acne.<br /><br />* a hair mask, especially if you have curly/frizzy hair or dandruff.<br /><br />* a natural Monistat substitute!<br /><br />* massage oil, especially if you have poor circulation.<br /><br />* a natural Preparation H substitute!<br /><br />* diaper ointment, safe for cloth diapers, too!<br /><br />* insect repellant.<br /><br />* makeup remover.<br /><br />* deodorant.<br /><br />* a natural KY substitute... ;)"
3136,"The jury is still out on this item. Perhaps it will take a little more time to feel the positive effects in my joints.  Easy to drink, though."
3137,"This product's ingredient profile on the Earth's Best website does not list ""Syrup Solids""; however, buyers should be aware that the formula has recently changed to now include this ingredient.  Their website has not yet been updated to reflect this (as of 7/18/2010).<br /><br />I spoke with their consumer relations department and asked them to update their website since the misinformation is misleading to consumers.  The change in ingredient profile to include syrup solids is disappointing.  I am now researching other formulas."
3138,"I saw that the price advertised for the ""Subscribe and Save"" was $6.79($0.35/oz).  Since that was a good deal I ordered it.  After I placed the order I did the math on my own and realized that it is actually $.43 per oz.  If I would have done the math before, I would not have placed the order.  I am very disappointed that the would lie about the price."
3139,"The biggest impediments to me buying this product for the first time were the price and whether my cat would actually eat it.  I have a 3 year old Siamese cat who has been eating Orijen (15.4 lbs @ $[...]) for over a year now, previously she had been on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DFU8"">Pro Plan Indoor Care Turkey and Rice Formula Dry Cat Food</a> (7 lbs @ $23.59) which I always considered to be a ""premium"" cat food until I began doing some research.  As you can see, Orijen ($3.44/lb) is slightly more expensive than Purina Pro Plan ($3.37/lb).  The big difference in price, however, comes from the ingredients.  Orijen is lower in carbohydrates and higher in protein which has resulted in my cat eating approximately 1/3 less food than she had been before.  I love that her new diet is better for her health, but also easier on my pocket.<br /><br />My concerns about whether she would like the new ""health food"" were completely unfounded.  Of course, when I first began mixing Orijen with her old food she would eat around the new food and save it for last, but that stopped after about the fourth bowl.  She has always been picky about the treats she will eat, but recently I've been experimenting with grain-free treats and she has been taking to them without hesitation.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who is shopping for foods to compare the ingredient labels.  I was shocked to find that Purina's Pro Plan looks more like something that would be concocted by a chemistry lab than a food producer.  For example, Purina Pro Plan contains ONLY Vitamin E, A, B-12, and D-3 supplements instead of the actual sweet potatoes, kelp, pumpkin, carrots, spinach, turnip greens, apples, and cranberries found along with the supplements in Orijen.<br /><br />Finally, the last big difference that I have noticed in my cat is the number of hairballs.  When she was on Purina's Pro Plan Indoor Care, my cat would spit up at least once a month if not every couple of weeks.  Now she spits up approximately 3 or 4 times a year and only when I leave for a decent length of time, such as during the holidays or a vacation.<br /><br />Overall, I couldn't be any happier with this cat food and I can't recommend it highly enough."
3140,"This lard is the BEST lard that you could EVER... wait... hold on a second... you can write up a review for lard?  Wow.  Really?  Isn't that kind of weird?  I mean... it's lard.  Internet lard.  What else do you really want to know?  Okay, fine, how about... probably you should avoid eating it directly from the package.  There.  Review for lard completed.  Have a nice day."
3141,"My baby with multiple allergies seems to love them. Great! However, some QA problems either in shipping, or packing, or distribution by Amazon.<br />Pros: Watermelon, Razmatazz, mango tango, and pomgranate pucker, orange<br />Cons:<br />1.

3142,"I've been using green drinks for over 6 years now.  I gave this one a try because of the ingredients.  It's comparable to some other green drinks.<br /><br />After drinking it for two days, I've felt a ton of more energy and no crashing. That never happened with my other green drinks. The taste is grassy, slightly minty and powdery.<br /><br />They recommend using 6 oz of water, but I have to dilute it with 24 oz to be drinkable.  Otherwise, it's just too much at one time.<br /><br />Overall, if you're interested in a great green drink at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong with this one."
3143,"Before I review, I will reveal that I am Indian. I grew up eating authentic, fresh Indian food, and now I cook authentic, fresh Indian food. NONE of the pre-packaged foods will come even CLOSE to freshly prepared food with freshly ground spices. It is impossible for a finely tuned Indian palate to relish pre-packed, factory-processed, preserved offerings. However, if you are not conditioned like me, then this is a great alternative to the restaurant fare we get in the US. Easy to use, quick and tasty enough. I bought the assorted pack and gave it to my non-Indian friends so they could cook their Chicken and Lamb curries....and they just loved it!<br />I give 4 stars to this product for trying its best."
3144,"SHAME on Amazon!  They claim to have them in stock, but cancel my order????  They advertised these on $6.98 and I bought, NOW they're $28.99???  Seems like Amazon has idiots running the pricing.  I want to CANCEL my Prime Membership!"
3145,"I can believe the source material used for this extract may have, by some miracle, exhibited strawberry genes...  But that's as far as I'm willing to admit that this has any strawberry flavor at all.<br /><br />What came labeled as strawberry extract tasted more like equal parts of:<br /><br />- Vanilla<br />- Burnt wood<br /><br />Nope, not only is this not suitable as strawberry flavor, it's not worth the bottle it came in either."

3147,"Barry Farms is known for their quality and rare, hard-to-find ingredients. Guar Gum is no exception, but anything can be found on Amazon, right? Barry Farms to the rescue!<br /><br />The thickening effect of Guar Gum is similar to gelatin, but the end result is more of a syrup than a jello. Guar Gum has a thickening power nearly 8 times greater than that of corn starch.<br /><br />Many ice creams and popsicles, even Italian ices, call for two main ingredients: Guar Gum (which, being the dietary fiber that it is, has been known to help lower cholesterol) and sometimes Xanthan Gum (also available from Barry Farms: [...]). Both of these gums behave quite differently, and Xanthan Gum can be harder to mix into your liquid solution, but both are effective means to preventing crystallization of liquids, which is how you get softer ice cream and popsicles instead of rock hard ice!<br /><br />Guar Gum can also be used in baked goods to increase dough yield and improves texture and shelf life, in pastry fillings to keep the pastry crust crisp and flaky, in dairy to thicken milk, yogurt, kefir, and liquid cheese products and to maintain homogeneity and texture of ice creams and sherbets, in meat as lubricant and binder, to improve the stability and appearance of salad dressings, barbecue sauces, relishes, ketchups and others dressings/sauces, and even in dry soups, and instant oatmeal mixes."
3148,"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own ""stand"" in order to fill it properly."
3149,"I ordered the extract to make rose ice cream, because you can rarely find it.  The ice cream turned out really great with this flavoring.  I used 1 1/4 teaspoons to flavor about 3 cups of ice cream.  It was a very light and perfect flavor.  You can definetly use more for a stronger taste.  The seller was also very quick with the shipping."
3150,"I have yet to find a superior dry cat food. I prefer to feed my cat a raw diet, but sometimes it isn't possible. An apartment doesn't have a place for an extra freezer so unfortunately a raw diet isn't feasible. This food is the closest to a raw diet you can get in a dry kibble. NO GRAIN and all meat proteins, exactly how cats want it. And like other reviewers commented, cats LOVE it. My cat always runs hopefully to his CORE storage bin when I start to open it and cries and begs until it is on his dish. My cat's coat is glossy, thick, healthy and barely sheds. His eyes are clear and bright. He has tons of energy and every year his vet is impressed with how healthy he is. No digestive problems, and no kidney problems that are so common in cats fed grain cat food.<br />I strongly recommend this cat food!"
3151,"This is great tea, but you need to know how to brew it. There is a viedo on Youtube. Westerners let it steep for 3 minutes creating bitter taste at times. You should pluck some of the cake 2 teaspoons of dry leaves, put it in a cup, pour hot boiling water on it, let it soak for 10-20 seconds then discard the ""first tea"" prepare your serving cups, pour fresh boiling water over perviously steeped leaves let it steep for 20-30 seconds then strain tea into serving cups. make sure all the water is gone and none left in the leaves as this will oversteep the tea. You can re steep the leaves up to 8 times.<br />great health benefits, enjoy."
3152,"Lemme tell you, before this miracle drink; I couldn't please my wife for more that 50 sec's without me tiring out. I mean after seeing her fat tail everyday. I started to get limp(in the spirit that is). And then my friend Bill(you know Bill from those commercials) showed me this... and let me tell you, never has my wife been so happy, not only can I please her for a whole 50 second's but now I can please her for FIVE HOURS! At first she was just a fat repulsive whale who lost her charms, and pizazz! Now after taking 5 hour energy I can take on any challenge including my wife, and my next door's neighbors wife.<br /><br />Not only has if kept me great with my wife, I also can now power my car off on the sheer energy that radiates from my body, for 5 hours I was on a town rampage, robbing banks, hitting the gentlemen's clubs, spray painting my obscene terms on corporate buildings, you know the usual teenager stuff. Yeah my life has been great since I started taking this miracle drink. The ladies love me, the me envy me... yeah I'm the talk of the town now. I even grew extra hair on my chest, and my 2 cabbages are too huge for my size 38 pants now, I have to move up to 44's.<br /><br />Pros:<br />.Keeps you up and going<br />.Makes you the talk of the town<br />.Makes you feel like you mean something again<br />.Fends off Mid Life crisis for 5 more hours<br /><br />Cons:<br />.You may wake up with bullet wounds<br />.You black out, and wake back up to your face on the news for some reason<br />.Your wife won't be able to walk for a month"

3154,"I tried these on a whim after hearing about Veggie Booty for a long time.  I knew I wasn't ready for VB, but I could certainly try out a new kind of cheese puff.  I previously thought that a day without Cheetos was a day wasted, so this was a big change.<br /><br />These are the best things ever!  They taste like real cheese and there's some variation in the intensity of the flavor - every single one doesn't taste exactly the same.  They aren't as crunchy as Cheetos and don't turn your fingers orange!<br /><br />After trying a couple bags purchased at the grocery store, I decided I loved them enough to invest in this 12-pack from Amazon.  Okay, so maybe I went a little wild and had a bag (or two) a day until they were gone - don't judge me!<br /><br />Try these out!  Buy a bag at the grocery store and then get the 12-pack.  You'll be very happy that you did!"
3155,"the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!"

3158,"It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6繕g (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors)."
3159,"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

3160,"I will preface this by saying that I have not tried this coffee.  But the reason I decided not to order is that at 10 grams of coffee per pack and 25 packs per container, it's really expensive.  250 grams =.55 lbs of coffee, which works out to almost $20 per pound. It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can.  Just as easy, too!  Solofill cups are great, by the way:-)"

I'm really healthy like that ;  So I invited some of my best girlfriends over for a tasting party and OMG things got CRAY!  I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like ""you look super slutty in those shorts"" and I was all like ""Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!""  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.  My first reaction was...""I don't think i can put something THIS black in my mouth""  But I had spent 55$ a case on this so I just sucked it down (that will show Ramondo LOLOLOLZZZZ....)<br /><br />It sorta tasted like I expected...like dirt water...but like not bad dirt water..like dirt water you drank when you went with your uncle to the river when you were six to go swimming with him and then you would jump in and accidentally drink a little river water.<br /><br />So overall i was pretty please with it but I was really upset about the TJ Max shorts and Ramondo so 2.5 stars<br /><br />XOXOXOXOXOXO-"

3163,Wayyyyy overpriced! K cups should average you around .50 cents a cup ! ! !
3164,"I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do."
3165,How many calories?  How much fat/trans fat?  How much protein?  Full ingredients should be listed - they sound great but nutritional info should be supplied.<br /><br />Too much of a puzzle to order without knowing....<br /><br />Petunia
3166,"Be careful!  After trying this wonderful blend of spices, with great complexity of flavor, that they say is made with 35 ingredients, I found ras el hanout in my local grocery store.  When I tried it alongside this one, there was no comparison.  Then I checked the label--the local one had only 8 ingredients!  It went into the trash and another order was placed to Zamouri.<br /><br />Ras el hanout can be used in a number of Moroccan dishes that are fabulous, although they tend to be complex to prepare--although if you're in the mood they are worth the effort.  But I also use it in tomato soup to give an amazing richness of flavor to it, transforming an everyday dish to a company dish.  Today I'm braising short ribs, and when I've cooked down the braising liquid I'll add ras el hanout to provide a symphony of flavor to it.  I haven't tried it with tomatoes and cheese on an omelet, but it's the sort of thing that's likely to be fabulous.  With a little experimentation, you'll find your own favorite uses for it."
3167,"Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now."
3168,"I expect 2006 to be a breakout year for shirataki noodles because people want to eat heathier and better by choosing foods that help them cut down on the carbs without sacrificing the taste and texture they adore. It's a delicate balance, but shirataki noodles are proving it can be done.<br /><br />I've already tried the Konjac brand of shirataki noodles and reviewed them for you last week. Now let me introduce you to another kind of shirataki noodles that are quite different from the Konjac brand. They're from a company called House Foods.<br /><br />House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are a unique combination of tofu and polysaccharide glucomannan (yam flour) to provide a genuinely authentic pasta texture that you frankly just don't get from the Konjac brand. I was extremely surprised by the House Foods brand and would definitely choose this brand over Konjac in a side-by-side comparison -- DEFINITELY!<br /><br />What's so different about the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles?<br /><br />For starters, each 4-ounce serving (2 servings per bag) has just 20 calories and a neglible 1g net carbs (3g total carbs minus 2g of dietary fiber). While that's not ZERO, it's certainly not bad, especially considering the trade-off you make in the texture of these noodles. These are perfect for every phase of livin' la vida low-carb for a nutritious and delicious pasta alternative.<br /><br />Also, they are sugar-free, gluten-free, cholesterol-free, dairy-free, and even have 10% calcium. What could be better?<br /><br />When I opened my bag of Noodle Shaped House Foods Tofu Shirataki for supper tonight, I immediately smelled the infamous fishy odor from them as I have come to expect from this product. But don't let that deter you away from enjoying the final version of this product, though, because the smell does go away quickly once you have rinsed them off and warmed them up for a few minutes either in boiling water or in the microwave.<br /><br />After draining the noodles in a collander, I transferred them to a bowl, sprinkled some garlic Alsosalt on them, and poured my favorite no sugar added spaghetti sauce on top. Mixing the noodles together with the sauce, I warmed it up in the microwave for about 2 minutes. Then I added some pepperoni slices and mozarella cheese on top and cooked it in the microwave for an additional minute. Mmmmmm. This looks so good!<br /><br />Voila! My low-carb House Foods Tofu Shirataki pasta dish was complete and it was time to eat.<br /><br />Since I had already tried another brand of shirataki noodles previously, I was expecting them to be similar when I put them in my mouth. But imagine my surprise when I started chewing and noticed they were soft like real pasta and weren't as ""chewy"" as the other brands. WOW! Check it out, this is AWESOME dude! Can you imagine shirataki noodles getting any better than this? My wife said they reminded her of Oodles of Noodles when she looked at them.<br /><br />House Foods has certainly found their niche in the shirataki noodles market and I applaud them for providing consumers with a unique choice. While the other brands of shirataki noodles certainly aren't bad products, the House Foods Tofu Shirataki noodles are the only ones on the market today that provide the actual look and feel of real pasta without the carbs or calories! CONGRATULATIONS to them for doing such an excellent job with their products!<br /><br />And apparently the consumer seems to like House Foods Tofu Shirataki, too, because their Fettuccini Shaped and Noodle Shaped products are currently #1 and #2 respectively on the list of bestselling Gourmet Foods at Amazon.com. How about that?<br /><br />So go ahead, give 'em a try! All you have to lose is excess weight. Eating pasta on a ""diet"" never tasted so good, baby!<br /><br />We haven't heard the last of shirataki!"
3169,"Tasty, yes ... but if you like eating margarine straight from the tub, with even more types solidified oils, add artificial coloroing and brand and label it so it resembles peanut butter (a natural butter), add sugar and spice and all that's nice ... this stuff is for you. Bought it ... loved it ... then found out what it really is ... fools gold."
3170,"I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the ""No"" button after ""Was this review helpful to you?"", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills!<br /><br />Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!)<br /><br />Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called ""Pill Pockets"". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small).<br /><br />I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Amazon.com they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, ""I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!""<br /><br />I've been happy with that decision ever since.<br /><br />I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets ""for dogs"".<br /><br />Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer.<br /><br />So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference!"
3171,"I was a Red Bull drinker, coffee drinker and whatever else I could get my hands on to give me the energy I so desperately needed to get through some days.  Someone suggested i try this 5 hour energy and WOW! It really did work without the ""drop"" afterwards. I have noticed that when I take more than 3 a week I start to build up a resistance and they don't work quite as well.... but hey! That's what happens when you drink caffein too, right?"
3172,"I was just about to buy this, until I saw in the ingredients that it contains MSG. At least this product description tells you (the others don't). If you are like me, that means you'll get a nasty headache after eating this. How about offering MSG-free noodles like I can get locally?"
3173,"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).  Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness.  I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium."
3174,"After finished several cans of DoMatcha Organic (which we REALLY love!!!), we decided to try the 2nd Harvest because of the cost factor.  Along with the decreased in price and increased in quantity, we also noticed a significant diminish in the aroma, earthy good taste, and potency.  It's noticeably bland as compared to the higher quality DoMatcha.  But....if you've never tried the other grade and/or don't like the stronger taste, then this one isn't bad for the price.  We prepared the tea the traditional way, with just hot water and whisking.  In addition, it has more bitter taste than the green can DoMatcha."
3175,"Let me tell you folks -- several years ago we tried the<br />Dreamfield pasta and also the spinach.  I never bought<br />diet kind of pasta again until I found out I had diabetes<br />a few months ago.<br /><br />Had to revamp my cupboard with foods to help my problem,<br />so I ordered this pasta from amazon.com.  You would be<br />as amazed as we were:  1) the first time I was questioning<br />cooking al dente following the instructions, but 2) cooking<br />just beyond al dente a bit made all the difference in the<br />world and this pasta tasted as good as Ronzoni or any other<br />pasta.<br /><br />I will bring this name with me to my next diabetes class<br />in August to share with all the other folks."
3176,"I expected these to be the typical CFL (packaged in heavy plastic) and really bulky with horrible color.<br /><br />Wow, was I wrong.  These bulbs arrived in a cardboard box and each one was small enough to get into my 14"" light fixture.  I replaced 6 100W incandescent bulbs with these 6 23W CFLs.  Not bad and I did not need to have all of that plastic packaging.  The bulbs do come on immediately, but as with most, they need about 120s to full hit maximum light output.  I liked these so much, I'm thinking about buying the candelabra six pack for another fixture.<br /><br />Now only time will tell if this was a good investment.  Will they really last?  I hope so."
3177,"This stuff WORKS for not only relaxing the muscles, but majorly helps PMS, Menopause symptoms, Hubby and I take it several nights a week. It helps us to sleep easier and deeper, too.<br /> It is a lot better than the Natural Calm without Calcium."
3178,"My rating is actually a ""ZERO"" but I had to choose between 1-5.  I will never order from this site again.  I ordered the Fukien Tea tree.  My order was delayed, which is not a big problem and not why I was disappointed.  But when the tree finally arrived - it was the wrong tree, I received the Gardenia tree.  The Fukien has the very tiny little white flowers which produce small red berries.  The Gardenia has larger flowers (which I do not like).  I was not happy that since there was a delay in the shipment of the Fukien tree - someone took it upon themselves to subsitute a different tree.  Did they think I would not know the difference???  If I wanted the Gardenia - I would have ordered it.  This shipment was returned the next day.  Hopefully I will be refunded in a timely manner!!"
3179,"I agree that this product may cost more from Amazon, but that's not a deal breaker for me.  The reason I buy from here is because my wife has 18 months of a 2 year tour in Afghanistan left to go and Amazon will ship certain food items directly to her APO address.  This is less expensive than me buying cases of the stuff and having to re-wrap and mail via USPS (neither Fedex nor UPS ship to APO addresses).  Even where she is, she has access to a microwave and bottled water, so these make a nice snack for when she has some down time and needs to eat.  Way to go Amazon!  I'm a Desert Storm veteran, and there isn't much better than getting care packages from home.  My wife took care of me when I was overseas.  Now it's my turn."
3180,"*****<br /><br />This Bedtime Tea from Yogi Tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. Bedtime Tea is made from organic licorice root, organic spearmint leaf, organic chamomile flower, organic skullcap leaf, organic cardamom seed, organic cinnamon bark, organic St. John's Wort leaf & flower, organic rose hips, natural orange flavor, valerian root extract, organic raspberry leaf, organic English lavender flower, stevia leaf, and passion flower extract. The taste is mild, delicious, herb-y, and very slightly sweet. It is subtle and lovely.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Bedtime Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />There is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. If you are taking MAO inhibitors or other prescription drugs, you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. There are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Best of all, it works...I love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. This is a great tea that I highly recommend.<br /><br />*****"
3181,"Six weeks ago I bought this for $19.99, now it is priced at $49.99. What is going on? This is just wrong."
3182,"I have been buying from Amazon for about a year and for the most part I have been very pleased with their prices and service. I have, however, learned that it is a good practice to check prices before having the luxury of having items sent to my door at no cost. For the most part Amazon's prices are in line and are competitive, but sometimes they run too far into left field and run head first into the wall. It is worth $10.00 to me to make a trip to Costco to buy a bucket of jelly beans. I bought this exact product today for $15.89 at Costco.  JohnD"
3183,"This green powder is SO good, I just had to get the word out. Others I've tried (Whole Foods brand, Barlean's Greens, Berry Green, many others) literally taste just like grass clippings, so you have no choice but to mix it with juice or a smoothie. THIS green superfood is palatable enough to drink just mixed with water! (Let me explain: do not expect it to be SWEET. This is a veggie drink, but it has an ever-so-slight hint of raspberry that's pleasing to the tongue when you gulp it down.)<br /><br />Healthwise, I've notice that my skin has gotten clearer, my energy levels have evened out, and I've harly even gotten a cough, let alone a cold, in the several years I've been drinking this- and I work with the sick and elderly.<br /><br />Yes, there is sediment, but that is because this drink has FIBER in it- the kind that is naturally in fruits and veggies.<br /><br />Accept it for what it is, compare it to the alternatives, and imagine how incredibly amazing you will feel. Then make your decision."
3184,Where is the quality control with AMAZON's grocery items?!! Half of the cans I received were SEVERELY DENTED. The product looked like it belonged on a 75% clearance rack at my local market. This is simply appalling and really disappointing. I had intially signed up for the automatic delivery subscription for this item but have since cancelled it if this is indicative of the product Amazon will be sending.
3185,"I bought this product based on all the 5 star reviews.  I really wanted to like it.  First I had it with cold milk.  Yuck, it tasted like cardboard.  Then I tried it warmed up like oatmeal & added brown sugar. Still tastes like cardboard.  How can anything so tasteless be loved by so many people?"
3186,"This fence was purchased about 3 years ago to protect my Koi pond from possums, and herons. It has been in continuous opperation since then with no loss of fish since it was installed.  Today I had to replace the woven perimiter cord because of continuity breaks due to rust at the cotter pin holders.<br />April 2010,  An update, I changed the cotter pin attachments to nylon zip connectors and resolved the rusting problem.<br /><br />Very succesful and a great product.<br /><br /> April 2010. An update on this product.  2 more years have gone by and the unit still works as new.  The  perimiter cord does need to be changed every year or two to keep the unit working at peak performance.  I bought a bulk roll of electric fence cord and keep it on hand."
3187,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side."
3188,"We have a Keurig coffee brewer and are always on the look out for strong but not bitter coffee.  The Emeril Jazzed Up Decaf fits the bill.  It is strong but without that bitter aftertaste that sometimes gets confused with ""strong.""  You would not know that you are drinking decaf coffee.  We have tried other Emeril K-cups and have been please with them as well."
3189,"As a huge fan of Keurig brewing, I was delighted to discover Solofill cups!  I have been using mine for a couple months and love the versatility and the ease of using this Kcup replacement.  Unlike the ""My Kcup"" holder that you can use with most Keurig machines, this little gem pops right in without having to remove the pod holder from the brewer.<br /><br />The Solofill takes about 2 tablespoons of coffee and that's the main appeal of this.  You can use your own ground coffee instead of always having to buy the pricey pre-filled Kcups.  It makes a great cup of coffee and allows users to buy any kind of coffee they please.  Some users have complained about cleaning the Solofill.  I find it easy.  Just tap the cooled coffee grounds on the edge of your trash receptacle and most will fall out.  Then rinse it out and it's ready to go again.  I keep two handy so I can be using one and cleaning the other.  I see this little invention as a great way to save money and have options as to the kinds and types of coffee you want to use."
3190,"I really like my new Senseo maker, but I found that with one pod the flavor was too weak and with two it was too strong.  So I found a way that anyone can make their own pods at home on another website.<br />Now I make my very own coffee pods with my favorite brand of coffee.  It costs a LOT less and the flavor is EXACTLY right."
3191,"Watch out three wolves t-shirt... The sharkbanana is the real lady killer. I've been the proud owner of the three wolves t-shirt for a couple of years, and coupled with a sick mustache, I've found that everything the reviews for that product say is true. However, upon recently coming across a sharkbanana, my eyes were opened to the infinite charm and prowess this toy brings to the table. This is not just a stuffed play thing people; this is the real deal. Yellow, gray, dashing, handsome... all of these things can be said about the sharkbanana. Durable, lovable, fearable... these things can also be said about the sharkbanana. But what I will say about the sharkbanana is this: I've said most everything I'll say about it before this final sentence."
3192,"I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier."
3193,"This is outrageous that the compound sold here can be added to meat parts to make them a ""whole"" product. The separation of parts to be rejoined is HIGHLY likely to cause sickness in people, such salmonella, e coli, etc. This product should be BANNED in the US and everywhere else, as it is a human hazard, not only in chemical composition, but in the practice of butchery in every place worldwide. Really."
3194,"How many INDIVIDUAL PIECES of gum do you get in this order of Jolt Caffeine Energy Gum, Spearmint, 12-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)?  This listing does not tell you exactly how much of the product you are buying."
3195,"I only feed my dog organic products treats and I love the ingredients in these treats.  Even better, my dogs love them too.  They are small and perfect for training.  Although I think they smell repulsive my labs cannot get enough of them.  They will harden over time, they are super-moist to begin with.  But I have found that they stay fresh much longer if you keep them in the refrigerator<br /><br />I also recommend the american chicken jerky that comes with the skin and coat optimizer, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0093W6YCE"">K9 Showstopper (Unflavored) 4 Lbs. + Free American Chicken Jerky - 3 Oz.</a>.  Another favorite in this household, they go crazy when they see the bag.  The jerky does come in much bigger pieces but they are easy to break into two, which I usually do and share half with each dog.  Now if I only watched my own diet as much as I did my dogs, I may actually get somewhere, lol.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, Amazon definitely has the best prices for pet treats and supplies.  I've seen these products at the store marked up almost double!  Cannot say that about everything Amazon carries but for these categories they seem to have cornered the market."
3196,"This package contains some foam seed holders, a few plastic cup sections to hold them, and some clear ""caps"" for the seed pods. Also, there are about a dozen blank circular papers to stick on the seed pods to identify your crop type. That's it!<br /><br />Re-use the original pod components and stay away from this item. $39.00 for $2.00 worth of plastic, paper, and foam."
3197,Same price as Dr. Foster & Smith.
3198,I know it's been said but I just want to echo this is Hydrogenated - DON'T BUY THIS!!!
3199,"They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either."

3202,if every seller was like JR mushrooms the world would be a much better place. They wont stop until there customer is completly satisfied. I ordered some winter black truffles from them and got my package lightning fast but came to find out that it wasnt what i ordered. I called JR and they said they sent better quality black truffles that cost more for the same price and this story doesnt end they even sent a jar of the original truffles i ordered just so i can taste the diffrence FOR FREE!!!!!!!!! Name another seller that would do that.

3204,"You reckon when the ad says ""whole rabbit"" you ought get the whole rabbit. I ain't got a head on this critter! My neighbor kids sure love playin with them rabbit heads. If I ain't got a rabbit head fer makin peace with them neighbor kids they prolly gonna come bust up my old ridin tractor. Without my tractor I can't even get up the corner store for no beer. Another thing is I ain't even got any intestines fer sausage makin! How is Easter dinner gonna be any good with no varmint sausages? This thing looks like it coulda been a guinea pig or a chinchilla or somethin. I mean, it tasted pretty damn good with hot sauce, but I reckon I oughta shot my own critter next time around. That or scrape one up off the main road, sure is cheaper. Least they left some bones in there for my ol coonhound to chaw awhile. Mavis gives it four stars but I'm only givin it two on account of no head or nothin to make sausages with. Reckon also if you ain't familiar with rabbit don't be expectin to feed no three grown men on one, ain't enough eatin on em."
3205,"There's really not much else to say about this - it's an incredible deal when compared to normal retail prices for saffron.  The saffron is good quality and noticeably fresh (the use-by date on mine was three years away) and it's a fraction of the usual cost.  One thing I particularly liked and that isn't made clear by the description is that this product is actually five one-gram boxes and not one five-gram box, so the saffron in the boxes you haven't opened yet will stay fresh longer.  Still, if you only use saffron every once in a while you'd be better off buying a smaller quantity even if you pay a little more by weight; this is a considerable amount of saffron.  I cook with it regularly so it's great for me, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
3206,"Well, I got my order in.  I may update this as things change.  I got 8 seeds, not 5, plus a free packet of sunflower seeds.  Nice.  prompt service.<br /><br />I can't Imagine how a reviewer could establish the seeds as 'nonviable"" on first glance.  But I grew up with maple trees, and I have to say these look just like the 'helicopters' that would delight me in fall.  Except smaller :)"
3207,"This was supposed to be a present for our neighbors but unfortunately we decided not to give it to them because a very disappointing item. The pictures on Amazon are quite deceptive giving the impression that it's a large box or tower. But the actual tower is barely taller than a bottle of wine and contains chocolate for no more than a couple of people.<br /><br />For $40, it's extremely overpriced. I'd look for something bigger if you want to give this as a family present."
3208,"Our family used this for years and even despite food allergies, we were able to use this. Now the formula has changed.<br />These ingredients are no longer listed on the label:<br />""Dutch Processed Cocoa Powder, Natural Vanilla""<br /><br />In their place you will now find:<br />""Natural Flavors""<br /><br />A call to the company and I was informed the flavors were a proprietary formula and they would not tell me what the ingredients were now.<br />Sadly, we are no longer able to use this product, as we do not eat anything we cannot know what the ingredients are ""exactly"".<br />I returned the unopened containers and advised my local grocer about this as well."

3211,"I couldn't find any place that would tell you what came in this variety pack.  So here you go.

I like tea don't get me wrong, but I was hoping to try a bunch of different coffees."
3212,"I'm going to ride on the previous reviewer's comments - with the exception that I use it for baking, but use 1/2 Zero and 1/2 original sugar requirements.  I don't notice any cooling and it makes the baked items easier for me to handle (less insulin, I'm a diabetic).<br /><br />So far I've made pumpkin spice cookies, banana nut bread and gingerbread cookies this way and it tastes fine in all of them."
3213,"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice.""  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky."

3216,"I was completely surprised when one of my customers brought this cake mix to me to use for their wedding cake, I made it and it was wonderful.  They paid $5.25 per mix, so once I realized how easy it is to use and how wonderful it is I began my search and was so excited to find it at such a good price.  I tried mixing in different ways, according to package directions and also separating the eggs and beating the whites and folding them in as the final step in preparation.  It was an effort to see how much height I could get.  Beating the whites separately did give a little more height, but all in all I determined it was not worth the extra trouble.  It is wonderful as it.  I used one mix in a 10 inch square pan, baked three layers and stacked them.  It made a very tall, nice, rich brownie-like cake.  I don't need gluten-free but am so crazy about this mix I have a case now, for my personal use.  I highly recommend it."
3217,"I ate a KIND bar (Almond & Apricot) for the first time yesterday. Fabulous taste, crunchy, yet soft and chewy. One thing that concerned me was the ingredient ""Glucose"". That could mean so many things. So I contacted the company to see what their glucose is made from. It's corn syrup. This was their response:<br /><br />""Thank you again for contacting KIND Healthy Snacks.<br /><br />Please note that this ingredient is corn syrup, but is not to be confused with high fructose corn syrup.  I am pleased to inform you that we use only all-natural, non-GMO corn syrup, which when combined with honey, helps us achieve the best flavor while allowing our bars to remain crunchy.  Please also note that 13 out of our 15 snack bars are considered low GI foods, which includes the flavor you are referring to, our Fruit & Nut Delight bar.<br /><br />I hope you find this information helpful.  Please also feel free to contact me with any additional questions or comments, and I would be happy to help you.<br /><br />KIND Regards,<br /><br />(Name Removed)<br /><br />Customer Experience Manager<br />KIND Healthy Snacks<br />(212) 616 - 3006""<br /><br />Corn syrup, even if it's ""non-GMO"" and not high fructose, isn't healthy. One of my children gets very sick eating corn syrup, so unfortunately Kind products will be on our list of things that we never buy.<br /><br />Kind is being deceptive in not listing where their glucose comes from. They probably know that it wouldn't be well received if that ingredient were listed as corn syrup, not glucose, which it should be."
3218,"I use this as a hair and scalp oil.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny. There's no greasy or residue buildup. It absorbs right into the hair and scalp,  If you apply to your hair, wait few minutes and then run your fingers through your hair, there will be no residue on your fingers--none.  Your hair will feel soft, supple, and look shiny.  A previous reviewer said she uses it on her skin. I do too. I usually put in on my face before bed.  Just like she said, it absorbs right into your skin and there is no residue.<br /><br />I started using it because my mom has uses it.  But, I never knew much about it.  I did an online search to find out more about this oil.  According to the information I got, with regular use, Coconut oil can help reverse sun damage and reduce signs of aging on your face and neck.  The article also said it helps eliminate ""liver spots""  The reason given was that coconut oil breaks down so fast that it really does absorb into the layers of your skin, instead of just sitting on the surface like so many face creams and lotions do.  It is good for the skin. I'm 50, and my skin is holding up pretty well.  I have very few ""liver"" spots near my ears, but absolutely none on my forehead and cheeks.  A lot of people have a whole face full of them by the time they are my age.  It is a healthy oil to consume.  It is solid, but it breaks down so easily in the body that the liver(the real organ) doesn't have to even get involved in the breaking down process, like it does with most fats we consume.  It's a shame, I always thought this was one of the worst oils you could eat.  Turns out, it's one of the best oils to consume.  If you do an online search, you can find a lot of information about the many benefits of coconut oil by an MD. You can even find out how it got it's bad reputation,"
3219,"We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA."
3220,"I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to ""double brew"" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off."
3221,"I added this to my grocery wishlist as an Amazon recommendation which popped up after I had added something else. I really should've taken a minute to look at the product page, or to realize what would happen before it was too late and someone bought this for me:<br /><br />Nearly HALF THE STUFF IN THIS THING HAS PEANUT BUTTER.<br /><br />To which I am deathly allergic.<br /><br />Peanut allergies are fairly common, so why the hell is half of this thing peanut butter crackers? I can see putting 10 packs of peanut butter crackers in here, maybe 12, but TWENTY?! WHY?!<br /><br />Let this be a warning to people with peanut allergies -- AVOID this product. You'll be stuck with a massive pile of crap you can't eat."
3222,"This product is excellent for a dog chew stick and my dogs absolutely love them.  It will not swell in their throats like rawhide can sometimes do.  The price on amazon is much better than at dog shows, pet shops or discount catalogues ( but still a little more expensive than Costco).  It came within a few days of ordering."
3223,"I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome.  Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated.  In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard.  He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive.  To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms.  I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094YKM"">Mosquito Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap</a>,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors.  I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard.  The results were stunning!  For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it.  For me it works better than any other product I've tried.  The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs.  I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather.  If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard.  A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control<br /><br />The active ingredient is Permethrin.  Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area.  It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin.  Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry.  Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in.  You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a ""likely"" carcinogen.  There is also a link to Parkinson's disease).  Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying.  Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you.  Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year.<br /><br />The product is applied by using a sprayer, like Ortho, SCOTTS ORTHO DIAL N SPRAY HOSE END, and setting the dial to 1/2 oz./gallon.  Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc.  The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes.<br /><br />While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside.<br /><br />konedog"
3224,"Having ordered two of this item, they were shipped in one small box losely packed with only air pillows.  One had leaked and the other had the seal broken.  I ordered only one replacement, explaining how all the other jugs of maple syrup were packed to prevent damage.  The replacement arrived undamaged, but again loosely packed in a small box with only air pillows.  As there are other alternatives on amazon that are shipped properly and the seals are more substantial, I recommend ordering one of them."
3225,"This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of."
3226,"I'm a bit granola obsessed, always on the search for a great tasting and healthy blend of ingredients. With reasonable effort to avoid hyperbole, Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters might be the best granola I have tried. The diverse grains are sweet and crispy, the nutrients are plentiful, and the price is right. I generally eat the granola dry, straight from the package, but I have eaten it with almond milk, making for a delicious, nutritious breakfast.<br /><br />For those who are curious, here is a breakdown of the nutritional content, as well as ingredients:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g)<br />Servings Per Package: About 11<br /><br />Calories: 120<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g (5%)<br />Saturated: 0g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg (1%)<br />Total Carb.: 22g (7%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g (20%)<br />Sugars: 5g<br />Protein: 3g<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor is, perhaps, a little too subtle, getting lost in the mix of the grains, but it does make its presence known. The variety of grains included is more robust than many other brand I have tried, especially the inclusion of quinoa. So there is a little something to please everyone.<br /><br />So, for those seeking a delicious, healthy granola blend, I highly recommend Kind Vanilla Blueberry Clusters. For my money, it may be the best grain blend on the market!"
3227,"After reading the ingredients, I was not happy. I expected truly healthy ingredients, as with Newman's Own products. It's been a while, so I can't recall exactly what led me to believe the contents of the bag were not much better than most other commercial pet food. If I believed it were a healthier option for my 6 cats, I would have continued to spend the 35 bucks a bag. By-product, meal, and added vitamins turn me off. I will continue to feed my cats IAMS (which is not really better, in my opinion, just 13 bucks less expensive) because they always want food available to them as I search for a reasonably priced and truly healthy food. I only feed my dog Newman's Own treats and food that I prepare myself. Sorry BB, I'll pass forever."
3228,"I had a scheduled subscription for this item and the quality was good.  However, they suddenly decided to jack up the by ~ 30% and at that point i canceled the subscription.<br />I now get 4 lbs of organic quinoa in one of the big warehouse chain store for 10$ and this seems such a rip-off."
3229,"Lemme tell you, before this miracle drink; I couldn't please my wife for more that 50 sec's without me tiring out. I mean after seeing her fat tail everyday. I started to get limp(in the spirit that is). And then my friend Bill(you know Bill from those commercials) showed me this... and let me tell you, never has my wife been so happy, not only can I please her for a whole 50 second's but now I can please her for FIVE HOURS! At first she was just a fat repulsive whale who lost her charms, and pizazz! Now after taking 5 hour energy I can take on any challenge including my wife, and my next door's neighbors wife.<br /><br />Not only has if kept me great with my wife, I also can now power my car off on the sheer energy that radiates from my body, for 5 hours I was on a town rampage, robbing banks, hitting the gentlemen's clubs, spray painting my obscene terms on corporate buildings, you know the usual teenager stuff. Yeah my life has been great since I started taking this miracle drink. The ladies love me, the me envy me... yeah I'm the talk of the town now. I even grew extra hair on my chest, and my 2 cabbages are too huge for my size 38 pants now, I have to move up to 44's.<br /><br />Pros:<br />.Keeps you up and going<br />.Makes you the talk of the town<br />.Makes you feel like you mean something again<br />.Fends off Mid Life crisis for 5 more hours<br /><br />Cons:<br />.You may wake up with bullet wounds<br />.You black out, and wake back up to your face on the news for some reason<br />.Your wife won't be able to walk for a month"
3230,"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats."

3233,"As of Nov 2007, the Keebler website says that each 16 gram serving contains 1 gram of trans fat!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it that this is terrible, because here are some quotations from the survey article<br /><br />Mozaffarian et al ""Trans Fatty Acids and Cardiovascular Disease,""<br />The New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354,<br />pages 1601-1613 (2006).<br /><br />Here are a few quotations from this article:<br /><br />""given the 1.2 million annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from CHD [""coronary heart disease""] in the United States, near-elimination of industrially produced trans fats might avert between 72,000 (6 percent) and 228,000 (19 percent) CHD events [i.e. ""heart attacks""] each year. These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.""<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />""The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.""<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />""On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.""<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook ""nutritional epidemiology"", and the most-cited author in his field. He has also written about trans-fat for a general audience in his book ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide for Healthy Eating."""
3234,"I bought this oil after reading all of the reviews that mentioned just how strong it is.  However, it can't be understated just how powerful it is.  I have been using it for making cinnamon hard candy.<br /><br />I put a half teaspoon of the cinnamon oil in a blue, Kitchenaid measuring spoon and set it aside for a few moments.  When I picked up the spoon again, I noticed that the oil was blue colored.  Upon further inspection, I discovered that the oil had actually eaten away at the plastic--it was like I had put nail polish remover (acetone) in the spoon.  Do not use this product with plastic measuring spoons!<br /><br />If you're planning to make hard candy with this as well, I'd also recommend that you let the sugar mixture cool quite a bit before adding the cinnamon oil.  Adding it at the 300 degrees F needed for the hard crack stage just leads to an overpowering cloud of cinnamon in your kitchen and flavorless candy.<br /><br />This product is good stuff; just be very careful when using it."
3235,"We have been eating hempseeds for sometime - they are an essential part of our diet.  I genuinely notice a difference physically when I eat them along.  This is a good price and we have gotten good quality from Amazon.  PLEASE SHARE SOME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!<br /><br />We must work together to make this available to the USA INCLUDING the farmers.  We live under an oppressive, authoritarian regime which, only a few years ago, would have attacked you for eating what is literally ""birdseed"".  Wild!<br /><br />2nd Review w/Suspcription Purchase Method<br />We have been delighted to have hemp seed finally taken off Schedule 1 Controlled Substance (along with heroin, etc.).  I know that is insane to even write this but that is the nature of the degenerate and immoral drug policy barons from the DEA and ONDCP - to twist reality and prohibit what are supposed to be free American citizens from obtaining some of the best food known to mankind beause their pseudo fear of people smoking flowers(and then engaging in violence against these same peaceful, free human beings).  NUTS indeed!!<br /><br />In any event, we have started using the suscription method.  This is a great price compared to anywhere else that I have found.  It actually takes 4 mos for us to go through 5 lbs.  Therefore, I signed up for 2 mos and simply skip one.  I will give very great KUDOS to Amazon for how they have set this up - at least for this product, both the product and the system work great!<br /><br />Greg Logan"
3236,"After doing a great deal of research on feline nutrition and the benefits of a grain-free diet, I decided to switch my three cats from their organic low-grain food to Wellness CORE. I'm not sure if it's the size or the smell or the taste or what, but despite doing the slooow transition method between foods none of my cats seem to like CORE very much. They also have a kind of hard time eating it because the pellets are so small and round that they just roll away from their mouths (this could be a good thing for cats that are prone to eating too fast, but that's not the case with my cats).<br /><br />The bigger issue though was that within two weeks of being switched to this food, my male cat developed urinary crystals and a partial blockage and had to be hospitalized. I don't know how much the food contributed to that, but the vet did mention that she has seen several cats develop crystals while on Wellness. In any case, all of my cats are being switched off of this food."
3237,"I became completely addicted to FiberOne. Absolutely loved it, until I read the ingredients label.

3238,"When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it."
3239,"I bought these to take by mouth, but after seeing the thick covering decided I didn't want to ingest that material--then decided to use the oil inside the capsule on my skin.  When cutting a small hole and squeezing out the oil, I noticed a small pellet that wouldn't melt on my skin in almost all the capsules.  Not sure what that material is, but am glad that I decided not to take them internally.<br />Also after doing some reading on Titanium Dioxide (listed as an ingredient)found that it is ""Classified as Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans"" by IARC.  Now I plan to stop using it on my skin and throw away the rest of the bottle--should've done my research before buying."
3240,"Buying 6 pounds of a grain you've never had can seem risky... what will you do with it all? But I took the risk and it paid off! Teff is great. I followed the porridge cooking instructions on the back, but made it savory instead of sweet. I let the tiny teff grains heat up/dry roast for a few minutes in the pot. I could hear them popping like crazy (sounds like electricity) and then I added water, organic chicken broth, ghee and black pepper. I let it cook longer than they say and then mixed a serving of it with chopped broccoli and chopped turkey, and then topped it with a drizzle of flax oil. My toddler said ""yum, yum, yum"" about 100 times. That's pretty cool.<br />We can now confidently add teff to our rotation of amaranth, quinoa, brown rice, millet, oatmeal, and spelt flakes.<br />We have a high protein, high fiber, vitamin packed winner!"

I tried this honey after reading of its capabilities but believing that it was just a high priced scam, but I'm desperate for releif so I spent the $28. 3 days after eating 1 tsp on bread per day my stomach pain was gone. I couldn't beleive it. I'm still waiting for it to return but it's been a couple of weeks now and I feel great.

The product description also clearly states that this product is ""organic green tea powder known as matcha with fine, organic green leaf tea"". In other words, the tea bag contains green tea leaves, along with a bit of matcha powder.<br /><br />It is an excellent tea if you are the casual tea drinker, or someone looking for a healthy, tasty and organic green tea (with a bit of added benefit of the matcha powder). If you are a true matcha drinker, then this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I find this to be an excellent organic green tea."

3247,"I wanted to find a broth/soup base that does not have MSG. As it turns out after I purchased this product, I found out that MSG comes in so many different name, one of them being Yeast Extract, the number one ingredient for this broth seasoning. Just google ""other names for MSG"" and you will see.  I now stop using this product, and always scrutinize all the food labels before buying as almost everything prepackaged/canned/processed food contains MSG.  I now make my own broth from meat and vegetable. It's more expensive for sure, but well worth my family's health."
3248,"This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, ""Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink.""  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
3249,"These are made in China, the country that sent the U.S. tainted raw ingredients which killed at least 149 people (ingredients for Heparin, a blood thinner medication).  China also exported pet food to the US that killed many pets.  Amazon did not include the ""Country of Origin"" listing for this product, but I read the box after I brought it home for my daughter and then threw them away."
3250,This is disscusting nasty and it even looks unappeling to me.  none of my friends even liked it. It tastes like sweet and sour but nasty at the same time not at all like chinese food.  its spicy and good for about one to two seconds.  then the tase over cmes your mouth whith such bad taste its hard to describe.  ewwwww is all i can say what a wase of molecules on the earth i dont even know who thought of this stupoid ass idea.  i have no clue whay i even bought it in the first place.  all i can say is DONT BUT THIS GUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3251,"These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.<br /><br />I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles""."
3252,"I ordered these noodles after reading stellar reviews.  Some folks in the reviews almost acted as if these noodles were sent from God.  I've eaten Ramen Noodles for quite some time and have found them to be a super inexpensive meal at .10 a package and sometimes cheaper.  I also like other readers mentioned don't always use the entire seasoning packet because of the high sodium content.  I found these noodles to have even higher sodium content.  Which I guess isn't too bad if you don't plan on eating the soup.<br />These noodles to me tasted just about the same as Ramen Noodles except the noodles were a tid bit larger in size.  If we are reviewing just the flavor packet, I would say it was pretty good.  Especially for those who like spice like myself.  I am use to eating super spicy foods and have a high tolerance to spice.  So they were right on par with what I am use to as far as the heat goes.  But I can see someone who doesn't eat spicy foods to find the seasoning super hot and spicy for them.  I like the idea of the dehydrated veggies that are enclosed to accompany the seasoning.  I am giving these noodles 3 stars because they are just overpriced Ramen in my opinion.  Plus the sodium content in the noodles is just unacceptable.  They surely can come up with lower sodium options. And lastly I give it 3 stars because of the price.  I would not expect to pay more than .50 cents a package for these noodles in a retail store. I would definitely buy these again but not in bulk."
3253,"Guys: Although this may not have the exact taste of a typical commercial brand peanut butter out of the jar, it is VERY CLOSE.  THIS IS THE ONE THAT SATISFIES A CRAVING FOR CREAMY PEANUT BUTTER without all the fatty oil.. It has no chemical or weird aftertaste (it's the most peanut-nutty tasting alternative out there which I've tried), and you really can adjust the consistency based on the amount of liquid you add.  Although  I previously favored the ""Better-n-Peanut Butter"" brand sold here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUQG3O"">Better N Peanut Butter, Better N Peanut Butter, Orig Lf, 16.00 OZ (Pack of 12)</a>and at Trader Joe's (which needs no mixing or preparation and has a real peanut butter texture), I must admit that the taste of ""better n peanut butter"" is not nearly as good as PB2 ( ""Better n Peanut Butter"" is less peanut-y and does have an odd sort of after taste) and it needs to be refrigerated after opening or it gets moldy (trust me.....yuck).<br /><br />Anyway, back to this product:PB2.  It has a very good peanut buttery taste and if you're cooking with it or mixing it in drinks or smoothies (like a banana smoothie), the texture is a non-issue. And having it in these 1 lb packages makes it much more affordable than buying the small jars sold here or directly from PB2's website (where they add $10 shipping).  And if you get at least three bags at Amazon, it qualifies for free shipping (it works out to about $8.70/lb). I also ordered the chocolate which is also good (not a strong chocolatey taste, more like a hint of cocoa), but my favorite is still the plain PB2.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Guys: I just tried another product from Byrd Mill and searched under peanut flour product (basically peanut butter with the oils removed as well) that's also very good  (it's cheaper than the PB2 product here if you buy the 5 1lb. option....I ordered -1- 5 lb bag and the total price with shipping was approx. $32.65 (therefore about $6.50/lb). The package comes in about 4 days after you order, but the one negative is that it is not vacuum sealed.  It's in a plastic bag with a twisty tied around it and then placed in a large paper bag with a folding top (the kind of bag that coffee beans come in, but bigger). In order to keep it fresh, I use about 1 lb. at a time and then vacuum seal the rest.  They also sell larger and smaller quantities at slightly steeper discount with little change in shipping. You have an option of getting a dark roast (more peanut-y) or light roast (less peanut-y tasting) and either 28% fat left in (at 6g/serving) or 12% (at 3g fat per serving).  I buy the dark roasted, 12% fat.  It is definitely more peanut-y than PB2 and is smoother and creamier in texture. The only big difference from the PB2 product (which I prefer, others may not....) is that Byrd Mill does not have any salt and sugar added (it's just pure roasted de-fatted peanut flour) so you'll most definitely want to add a little salt (maybe even a little honey) to the mixture to suit your taste if your using it plain (like on a sandwich, or with crackers or right on a spoon.  So if you find yourself snacking on peanut butter every day to satisfy your peanut butter cravings, go ahead and try this."
3254,"My dogs love these chews, and I feel like I am doing something to help them with their dental health.<br /><br />I will say that I no longer buy the petites because they are just too eas to chew up, even for my six pound Chihuahua.<br /><br />I now buy the bigger ones and cut them in half, and my only issue with the larger sizes is the inconsistency of thickness in the pieces within a bag. Some of them are so thick even my 30 pound dog gives up on them."
3255,This review is not about the product - the product is fantastic. This is a comment about the outrageous rip-off price. You can buy the same box of Guayaki Yerba Mate 25 Tea Bags at Trader Joes for $4.29 per box compared to the price being asked here. That's crazy. Just my 2 cents.
3256,"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these!"
3257,"Many of us want to know the calorie count for foods.  I will go to grocery store to see if any of the cereal bars are now lower in calories.

3258,"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.<br /><br />No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.<br /><br />It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.<br /><br />On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner."
3259,"I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop ""regular"" but instead has ""Extra Bold"". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes."
3260,"I purchased this item believing it was ""Manuka Honey"" , after receiving this product through Amazon, not one word of Manuka is mentioned on the product label, or ingredients.  Now after some thorough research, I have learned that Manuka Honey is a Mono-Floral Honey (the antithesis of Multi-Floral Honey) meaning that the bees get their nectar from one plant in this case the Manuka Plant.  So Manuka Multi-Floral Honey is an oxy-moron & completely misrepresented to a lay person, I had to do research before I realized I got jipped. There is no mention of Manuka anywhere on the label. Caviot emptor!"

3263,"Great Product. I have one jar in the kitchen. It doesn't spoil so one less thing in the fridge. I use it as a high heat oil for saute veggies. It works well and leaves a very light coconut flavor.<br /><br />The other jar is in my bathroom. I use it on my skin instead of body lotion. Best ever! A little goes a long way. Can also be used on your hair - condition with some oil, then wash and rinse.<br /><br />I love it"
3264,"We have spent a number of weeks in NZ over the past 5 years and discovered this honey - as well as hiking through Manuka bush country.

3265,"Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops. My wife favors a latte or mocha, so she found Dark Magic too strong. I prefer an Americano, so I liked this roast.<br /><br />I tested the Dark Magic blend on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) setting to capture the strongest flavor. It was a nice improvement from Green Mountain's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI"">Fair Trade Gingerbread</a> I drank earlier in the week. Dark Magic is bolder than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y"">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS"">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a> but no more bitter.<br /><br />If you need more caffeine, I recommend you add a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00284TTG2"">SToK Caffeinated Black Coffee Shot</a>.<br /><br />In summary, I like ""tres intense"" roasts and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a> is the darkest I have found in the Keurig lineup.

3268,"I had a terrible plugged drain that nothing would clear. Finally a friend recommended that vinegar might dissolve the blockage. This had so frustrated me that I decided to buy the best vinegar available. When my box of Modena Extravecchio Gold Seal arrived in the mail I immediately went to work. Within minutes, my kitchen sink was flowing freely once again.<br /><br />I am a bit upset about the short listed shelf life of only two years. I'm afraid that my drain will stop up again just after the two year shelf life has expired and I will be forced to purchase a new case. Given that it is already 75 years old it seems like an unreasonable limitation, but of course I wouldn't risk going against the manufacturer's recommendation.<br /><br />It certainly commands a small premium compared to other drain-cleaner products, but it is well worth the extra money!"
3269,"This company really sends out a great sour dough starter and instructions.  I recommend you also buy the Sour Dough Starter Kit that comes with the wide mouth jar and recipe book.  We followed their instruction exactly and the bread turned out better than any Sour Dough that we can purchase from a store, really nice and chewy, and is incredible when toasted.  They show you how to make it extra sour by ""feeding"" it with more flour and water over time.  We used pure filtered water and King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour in our recipe, my wife and I really got excited about how great it tasted.  We let it rise 2 times, and did an extra rise overnight.  The dough was so bouncy that I am going to try and make pizza dough next.  I tried other sour dough companies on Amazon, but this one is the best.  As a native San Franciscan I appreciate great sour bread, and this is the greatest.  Just be sure to give it extra ""feedings"" in order to get that extra sour taste. Making this type of bread takes TLC, but the time you put into it will pay big dividends.  It is going to be fun trying their other starters, such as the Alaskan and Italian starters.  We are into Whole Foods and like to cook things ourselves so we know what is in the product.  The recipe we used had flour, starter, water, honey, milk, and salt, that's it hard to believe it made such wonderful bread."
3270,"Well, I can't speak for others who may have had a different experience, but my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012182G"">Fresh Whole Rabbit</a> did NOT arrive whole.  No head, no entrails, no paws.  For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store.  Granted, I did go with the ""Buy it Used"" option, to save a few bucks, which may account for some of the wear-and-tear.  Buyer beware."
3271,"I am too tired to do a video review. Maybe, I will do one later. This oil is a must have for ladies with natural hair. I am AAF with 3c/4b hair that has been thinning since the birth of my child. I have been natural for 4 years and mostly keep my hair in cornrows because of this dry, hot weather. I do ""baby"" my hair. Weekly conditioning, bi-weekly deep condition, satin scarves etc etc. I used this oil for my weekly conditioning. I put this on my dry hair, let it sit for a few hours (after dinner). I washed it out with apple cider vinegar and applied some shea butter and went to bed. When I wokeup I had a new head of curls!! Perfect little corkscrew curls and they were so moist. I have also been using it on my ends when I were my ponytails (between braiding). I have only been using this oil about two weeks but it really has made a difference in my curl definition and the moisture content of my hair. I highly recommend this proudcts to my natural girls!! It does have a smell to it but it disappears throughout the day. Be sure to rinse it out well."
3272,"My vet gave him a prescription diet which helped him tremendously but he HATED it and wouldn't eat it until he just couldn't stand being hungry any more.  With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!  And so was my little dog!"
3273,"I purchased the matcha powder in hopes to replicate the green tea lattes at starbucks. Starbucks matcha powder contains more sugar than matcha, so i thought Id try creating my own. This product is amazing and tastes exactly like the green tea lattes. I chose not to add a syrup, but it would work very nicely. To have a similar green tea latte like starbucks i use this recipe:<br /><br />1 cup of hot milk separated (I use skim)<br />1 teaspoon of matcha powder<br />3 tablespoons of hot water.<br />Sugar/Splenda (optional)<br />Choice of Flavored Syrup (Optional)<br /><br />First disolve and mix the hot water with the matcha powder. Get all the clumps out before continuing. Then add about 3/4 cup of the milk to the matcha water mixture and mix to completely blend. Using a frother, froth the remaining milk until it resembles a foam. (I also purchased a small travel frother from Amazon) Add it to the top of the latte.<br /><br />Add sugar/spenda if desired.<br />Add syrup if desired."
3274,"I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing."

This little spice pouch greatly exceeded my expectations by making it easy to make a very flavorful rendition of it using only one pot.<br /><br />1 cup of water, 3 tablespoons butter (I used Smart Balance and it came out great), a pound of chicken (the bagged frozen Tyson grilled chicken strips work great) and 20 minutes and you have a dish that closely approximates the restaurant version.

3278,"(in response to the last glowing review)<br />Well then, why is what you're saying running totally counter to the care sheet that came with the bonsai boy juniper!?  That plus I'm positive it advertised ""eligible for free shipping""--but alas I paid the 8.95 anyway. AND the picture is full and lush. Mine is pretty darn thin compared to that....... But the worst part is, the Bonsai Boy care sheet says specifically if you bring it indoors to keep it DARK. This is saying keep it well-lit while indoors. I live in Northern New England. It's too cold almost 6 months out of the year to keep it outdoors, and I chose Juniper because the reviews I read said it was a good beginner tree. Which is it, lit or dark indoors?"
3279,"The banana plant, along with a Hoya carnosa 'Strawberries and Cream' (rated separately), were ordered together and arrived together just 3 days after ordering, an admirable accomplishment. The only thing that could/should have been done better was in protecting the banana plant's delicate leaves. They were simply suspended in a plastic-foam 'peanuts' that provided very good insulation, but they shifted about in transit resulting in 3 of its 5 leaves to be broken and damaged. I have no doubt that given the plant's overall health otherwise, will recover in a reasonably short amount of time, but is the reason for the 4-star rating. I found the condition acceptable as the plant was ordered for myself, but would not have found it acceptable if the plant was ordered as a gift for someone else. The only other, very minor complaint is that neither plant arrived with a plant tag.<br /><br />In summary, given that both plants were very reasonably priced and arrived quickly and in good-enough health that I would order from them again. I would suggest that if the plants are intended to be gifts that a note to this effect be included with the order."

Amazon e-mailed to say it went back as unable to deliver. Welllll you have to get it to the right state first of all, then the correct town, before you can actually look for my house.. Duh. This time it went from Dallas to Commerce City,Colo. Then 4 days later it is signed for in Irvine,Tx. I hate to say, but Commerce city is still a good 300 mi. from my home town. Dhl here in town is also way lousy for claiming they attempted delivery, when they have not. They claimed to have attempted to deliver the last Annie's shipment i got, even had a time down, and I was home that entire day and never saw hide-nor-hair of their van. that time the boxes had gone to Salt lake City, then Pocatello Idaho, before circling around and finally arriving here. So be prepared to have it take awhile, or maybe even not at all if my experiences are any example."
3286,"I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do."
3287,"We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as ""extra bold"" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand."
3288,"Maca powder = maca flour. I have cooked with maca flour ten years, as a baking and cooking ingredient/flavoring. In Peru, maca flour, or ""harina de maca"" is a relatively cheap regional culinary flour. Raw Reform is a great specimen of this culinary flour; ideal for cooking, an excellent nutty flavor, it's bitterness subsiding with heat. A decade ago I could buy 'harina de maca' for $8/kg (and in Peru, it's a mere $2-4/kg) - now I see this same inexpensive Peruvian cooking flour sold as a ""raw superfood"" at an inflated price. It's very odd to have witnessed this metamorphosis.<br /><br />The reason I gave this ONE star is simple - this company (among several others) suggests that you to eat this flour raw. Like other cruciferous roots, maca can be particularly difficult to digest when raw. Not only is it fiber-dense, it contains lots of goitrogenic compounds (a term which means 'thyroid-interfering,' not ""goiter causing"") - that's why the raw root and it's flour is so bitter - it's no wonder people have digestive issues and occasional hormonal (thyroid) complaints with raw maca. The one time I ate it raw, I experienced the stomachache, too! Maca is dense in fiber and thyroid inhibiting/goitrogenic compounds (glucosinolates and isothyocyanates), both of which are lessened greatly or deactivated by heat. Among the people who grow it, maca is not considered healthy unless cooked. It is therefore a great paradox that the ""raw food"" crowd has gotten hold of this vegetable that has always been, and by all accounts always should be cooked. This supplement is being backed by people whose basic food philosophy avoids the plant's very identity in human use. It would be like eating turnip flour, raw (except maca can even more bitter than this, in fact most of the lepidiums are). Back into antiquity, maca has had to be cooked in order to be gentle on digestion, on metabolism, and it has been cooked traditionally for this purpose.<br /><br />I have used the raw maca flour in cooking since 2002 where I first read about it in Chris Kilham's book ""Tales from the Medicine Trail"" and began following an interest in this ancient food. I do use raw maca flour for cooking, baking, in pancakes, confections, etc. Where you can get it inexpensively, it is excellent for such uses. For therapeutic effects and everyday drink mix usage, presently I employ a 'black gelatinized' maca - it seems to be the strongest type energetically and for sexual effects, and 'black root' is my personal preference. 'Gelatinized' means that it's fiber has been removed (skimmed off), and goitrogens denatured - it is a few times concentrated over the powder / flour. Naturally, it is less bitter than any uncooked flour product. The gelatinized processing was developed specifically to address the digestion/goitrogen issue inherent with the root. That's the process' entire purpose - that's why it even exists.<br /><br />The trend in ""health food"" circles says to eat maca raw, in order to glean the mood, stamina, and sexual benefits which Andean people have known for thousands of years. These merchants never mention how the plant has always been prepared - cooked - perhaps the most crucial aspect of it's identity. Why argue from antiquity about all the health benefits, while ignoring the food's ethnobotany? It's a mix of mistaken understanding, and because there's profit in re-selling a highly marked up culinary flour. I see $20.00 - $25.00 a pound slapped on maca flour in health food stores -- on a product which can be found $2-4 a kilogram in Peru ($1.36 - $1.81/lb!). This is precisely why some regional foods / surpluses suddenly become ""superfoods."" In maca's case there is a genuine positive effect being felt... so, like the mood boost one feels with coffee, maca is an easy sell. Most companies have a whole marketing song & dance... and they make a LOT of money.<br /><br />Pay a price of $20/lb only for the gelatinized product, which has actually been processed for immediate consumption. Do not pay this for a re-packed culinary flour."
3289,Fresh Whole Rabbit was DOA. After calling Cloverdale customer service the matter was cleared up. The fresh whole rabbit was supposed to be dead. They let me send it back for a full exchange but I only wanted an alive animal in return. Ended up with a bunch of rabbits' foots instead \;
3290,"I've purchased a few JBMC whole beans from different roasters over the years, and wanted to share my experience with this particular seller.<br />I was running low on my normal supply of JBMC and decided to give this seller a try, because of their slightly lower price, and they had it in stock and shipped it out immediately.<br /><br />My opinion is that the JBMC beans from this seller were either old, or something went wrong during their roasting process.  The grind has a slight sour smell when brewing, which in turn gives a slight bitter taste.<br />Good JBMC is very smooth; on the lighter side; slightly sweet and spicy with a nice finish.  Like good 100% Kona coffee, there is no bitter aftertaste.<br />I tried different grinds, #16 and #24, and prefer the #24 grind for a single cup brew.<br />The place I normally get this bean from (Lion Coffee) did get a fresh batch of JBMC beans in last week, so I was able to compare both; and the Lion JBMC roasted whole bean wins hands down.<br />My recommendation is that if you are willing to spend $30-$50 a pound for JBMC beans, make sure it's direct from one of their certified distributors like Mavis Banks."

3293,"It would be difficult to find a better pure extract than this Nielsen-Massey offering.  Like several other reviewers here, I use a lot of this product in baking.  Over the years I have used quite a number of different brands, some out of necessity, and some out of curiosity.  I have yet to find a better one than this!  I do not want to sound like a snob, but the few dollars extra you pay for the real thing is worth it.  I cringe when I see the imitation vanilla on the shelves of grocery stores, as I know how much difference the flavor of the final product will be when using it.<br /><br />Quite often, even with the better grocery store brands, you get a strange and rather unpleasant after taste.  Not so with this stuff!  It should also be noted that the flavor here is extremely intense, so slightly smaller amounts are called for in some recipes.<br /><br />It always seems a shame to me to got to all the trouble of making a cake, or any dish for that matter, and not strive for perfection, giving it up for a relatively few saved cents.<br /><br />In addition to cooking needs, I have found that if you moisten the tip of your finger just slightly with this product, and rub just a small amount in a small area on the bulb of your bedside lamp, you get the most marvelous and sensual aroma...not overwhelming, but just slightly lingering.  Wow!<br /><br /> I really cannot see how you can go wrong here.  The price is equivalent to what I have been paying locally and an 8 oz bottle will last quite some time with reasonable use."
3294,"I was skeptical, as I'm sure you are! I read review after review just to make sure I knew of any known issues. Which are few are far between. To say the least, I am absolutely amazed by this litter box and wish it came out 10 years ago!<br /><br />I am, now, the un-proud owner of a Litter Mate litter box. For the last year I have used it as a regular litter box (where I would scoop myself. Just too frustrated with the mechanism of the whole thing.) Anyway, I finally found a litter that did a decent job in that box, it's hard to find one! I settled on Tidy Cats scooping litter. Well, one day I was comparing prices online at my local grocery store and at Target when I came across this system. I decided to check out Amazon and the reviews.<br /><br />With little hesitation I ordered the litter box, pellets, and pads. I also put the pellets and pads on Amazon subscription to receive 15% off each order and I could cancel at anytime. I ordered the pellets and pads because I didn't think the litter box came with anything and I was anxious to use it once I received it. Well, it did come with a 4 pack of pads and a 3 lb bag of pellets, enough to get you started.<br /><br />I set it up right away, right next to their usual litter box. I checked the pad the next day and a cat, or two, had used that box! I was so excited! I left it there for 3 weeks because neither one of my cats went #2 in the new box. I was getting discouraged. I did what was suggested by putting some of the pellets in the regular box so the cats could get used to the feel of them. Still nothing. So finally, with fingers crossed, I eliminated the regular litter box and only made available the Breeze litter box. I came home from work that evening and prayed they would use the box for both duties.....AND THEY DID!!! I was thrilled!!<br /><br />I have never smelled the #2 like some reviewers have mentioned, I don't know if they do it while I'm away or asleep, but there has been no odor.<br /><br />I would suggest either getting more than one box if you have 2 or more cats. Tidy Cats suggests 1 box for each cat plus one. I only have one box and change the pad 2 times per week and it has worked perfectly, but knowing how well it works and how easy it is to maintain, I will be buying a second one!! I love that there is no litter to vacuum up or get tracked on the wood floor only to step on in bare feet!<br /><br />I love this litter box!!<br /><br />August 9, 2008: UPDATED I still LOVE this litter box!! It is by far one of the best things ever invented! I am telling all my cat owner friends about it and insist they buy this! I have to admit, I am a lazy litter box care taker, because of a busy life. This litter box makes it a lot easier to care for and it's so quick to clean! I plan to move it to a bathroom soon so I can flush the solids since I tend to scoop them out every day or two, it would make it that much easier.<br /><br />If you are hesitating at all, you really should give it a try. I bought it before they reduced the price by $20! I risked $40 to try it, you can risk $20!"
3295,The Keurig system is marvelous--and the Dark Magic coffee is delicious. But Amazon is falling down on the job a bit with this price--you can buy a box of 24 K cups from the Keurig site for $13.95--and get a discount as muc as 15% if you are a repeat buyer.
3296,"I really like the taste of this dry milk.I use it since I'm lactose intolerant. However, it's really difficult to mix.<br /><br /> i tried a whisk as per the instructions, but finally had to resort to a blender. Other than this drawback, it's really good."
3297,"We have had it less than three months. We have to descale about once a week. Our water has 1 gram of hardness. Almost perfect. They have sent new water reservoir (which by the way Keurig has great help line). But, honestly for the money the Mr. Coffee is better.  You just have to add the water each time. But it works each time. It is very hard to get a consistent full cup of coffee out of this Keurig machine."
3298,"Anyone who doesn't like this product is probably a fat slob. This is an amazing substitute for the extremely fat and calorie dense original. After trying this, I don't think I'll ever eat traditional peanut butter ever again!"
3299,"If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.<br /><br />But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?<br /><br />Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?<br /><br />Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a ""perfectly"" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.<br /><br />This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends?"
3300,"I definitely agree with all the good things that the other reviewer say about this product. I've used MRPs (mostly Met-Rx) for decades and also attest to their benefits. However, I gave it only three stars because I strongly object to the ad's omission of the fact that Labrada Nutrition's Lean Body contains sucralose.<br /><br />Sucralose replaced aspartane---which from its invention at Searle was known to damage brain cells---as the no-calorie sweetner of over whelming choice by food packagers.<br /><br />Regrettably, sucralose is known to kill off our probiotics, the bacteria that enable food's digestion!<br /><br />We all have the right to take our chances. Nevertheless, the vendors of products that they encourage us to eat have the duty to inform of what those chances are."

3303,"I bought this at Whole Foods so just naturally assumed they would be made in the US or Japan or somewhere reliable. NO. MADE IN CHINA. Very very sad and disappointed. My baby thought they were ok, but after a while got bored of it. I realized they were made in China half way through the box. Not letting baby eat any more of these tho and not buying it. I just don't trust ingesting anything made in China.<br />----------<br />*UPDATE*<br />----------<br />Whole Foods recalled this product from their shelves (at least the WF's around here). Can't buy this product anymore at WF."

3305,"8 years ago, I was desperate trying to find a natural remedy for my brother's early phase liver cancer since surgery would almost destroy the body and my brother won't live long after that and he was too young to lose life.  Luckily my coworker suggested me to try Essiac Cancer Remedy. I did a through research on Essiac and believed this tea was going to save my brother's life and it DID. He is still well till now.  Later I suggested this tea to a few more cancer patients and the results were promising.  Two of them with early cancers were healed; the doctor just couldn't find any cancer trace on the pre-scheduled surgery table.  There are 2 late phase cancer patients (late means cancer had been spread to different organs and the person was dying), who drank the tea and lived a few more months and died peacefully without any pain and sufferings, which proved what said in one of the Essiac books that the tea helps with a painless death if it's a Terminal cancer. I also learned that the results are much better with patients who eat little or no animal products because animal food acidifies the body, speeds up cancer spreading and weakens the immune system --- in 1931, Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for showing that ""cancer thrives in acidic conditions.""  For more information about this tea, you may read related books on ""Essiac"".  I hope more western people will believe that the best heal is often the most nature and simplest which God created in the very beginning."

3309,"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though.

Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly."

Will never order candy again from any of these folks."
